\chapter{The Lifecycle of Deep Convective Cores and their Associated Anvil Clouds Observed over North America}


% \begin{abstract}
% Deep convective clouds play an important role in the climate and are the cause of a number of extreme weather events.
% As global warming causes an increase in the frequency of storms and related extreme weather events, it is vital that we better understand the response of deep convective clouds to anthropogenic influences.
% Observing these impacts is, however, difficult due to both the complex behaviour of these clouds and the many interactions and feedbacks between deep convective clouds and the environment.

% By developing a novel method for detecting deep convective clouds, we can detect and track cores and their associated anvil clouds over their entire lifetime.
% Using a year of observations over the continental United States, we analyse the properties of developing deep convective cores and anvil clouds, and how these properties are linked.
% The spatial patterns of observed convection show notable changes with the seasonal cycle.
% Furthermore, we observe differences in the diurnal distribution of deep convection between different regions, and impacts of the diurnal cycle on the properties of observed developing deep convective clouds.
% In particular, we see strong land/sea contrast, the impact of the sea-breeze effect on convective initiation in coastal regions, and an increase in the intensity of convective growth with later time of initiation over the Great Plains region.
% Despite these changes, some properties -- such as the lifetime of the developing cloud core -- show little regional variation.
% Finally, we link the properties of growing cores to those of single- and multi-core anvils, and show how multi-core anvils can have larger lifetimes and extents, despite the properties of individual cores being similar to those of single-core anvils.

\section{Introduction}  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

Deep convective storms play an important role in both the weather and climate of North America.
\acrshort{dcc}s are responsible for a wide range of extreme weather events, including heavy rainfall and flooding, hail, derechos, hurricanes and tornadoes.
Additionally, \acrshort{dcc}s---in particular \acrshort{mcs}s---provide the majority of precipitation across many regions of North America.
As a result, a wide array of observational networks have been deployed to study deep convection over North America, including satellite observations and cloud radar.

Previous studies using satellites to track and study \acrshort{dcc}s over North America have primarily focused on \acrshort{mcs}s.
Although more recent research has combined satellite observations with radar and precipitation measurements to study both \acrshort{mcs} and isolated convection (e.g. Feng), prior datasets have not studied both core and anvil properties of \acrshort{dcc}s.

By leveraging the full temporal and spatial resolution of \acrshort{goes} \acrshort{abi} observations over the \acrshort{conus}, we have created a 5-year dataset of observed \acrshort{dcc}s, tracking both cores and anvils.
By analysing this dataset, we are able to show new discoveries about the lifecycle of \acrshort{dcc}s, and how their properties correspond to those of their cores.

\section{Data}

    \label{fig:abi_zenith_angles}
\end{figure}

To detect and track \acrshort{dcc}s across North America, we use \acrshort{abi} \acrshort{mcmip} data from the 6.2, 7.3, 10.4 and 12.4\,\unit{\mu m} channels observed in the \acrshort{conus} region, as described in section \ref{sec:abi_data}.
We use the full extent of the \acrshort{abi} \acrshort{conus} domain of 2,500~pixels E--W by 1,500~pixels N--S.
This domain covers a region of around 60--120\,\textdegree W in longitude and 15--60\,\textdegree N in latitude, covering an area of approximately 5,700 by 3,900\,\unit{km}.
Figure~\ref{fig:abi_zenith_angles} shows the satellite zenith angle of \acrshort{abi} observations across the \acrshort{conus} domain.
The large sensor zenith angles in the North-West of the domain may introduce large errors in the detection and tracking algorithm, so for the rest of this chapter we will only consider \acrshort{dcc}s detected east of 120\,\textdegree W and south of 50\,\textdegree N.
As the viewing angle increases detection and tracking become more difficult.
This is due to the confounding between vertical and horizontal motion, and also due to the area of each pixel increasing with the zenith angle.

Five full years of data---from the start of 2018 to the end of 2022---are used to produce a dataset of detected \acrshort{dcc}s and their properties.
This period spans all complete years of operational data from \acrshort{goes}-16 \acrshort{abi}.
To improve to continuity of observations, we then perform a gap-filling procedure.
If time gaps between observations of greater than 15 minutes are present we use observations from the full-disc \acrshort{abi} scan to fill these gaps.
Full disc imagery is typically available every 10 or 15 minutes depending on the operating mode.
This gap filling is particularly important during the periods in which \acrshort{abi} uses its mode 4 scan pattern, in which no \acrshort{conus} domain scans are made, but the full-disc is scanned every 5 minutes.
Using the full-disc observations allows us to maintain temporal sampling throughout these periods.


\section{Method}

Detection and tracking of convective cores and anvil cloud is performed using the method described in section~\ref{sec:tracking_method}.
Initial detection of \acrshort{dcc}s is performed separately over 24-hour periods spanning from 12:00:00~\acrshort{utc} (approximately 6am local time over North America) to the same time the next day.
This 24-hour period was dictated due to performance constraints, as the large domain combined with the high spatial and temporal resolution of \acrshort{abi} data results in a large memory requirement.
This time corresponds with the minima of convective activity over land, and so was chosen in order to minimise the number of \acrshort{dcc}s missed at the start and end of the detection period.
Each period is extended by six \acrshort{abi} observations at each end to ensure at least one hour of overlap between successive days.

To track long-lived \acrshort{dcc}s that last beyond one day, we apply a linking algorithm which combines \acrshort{dcc}s observed across multiple days.
The linking algorithm combines \acrshort{dcc}s detected at the same locations within the overlap period of two daily detection files.
Splitting and merging of objects is taken into account, so a single object which splits into two, or two objects which merge into one in the subsequent file are all considered a single, tracked object.
The linking algorithm is applied separately to each month of data for performance reasons.

After linking, a processing step is applied to calculate the properties of detected cores and anvils at each step of their lifecycles.
Finally, core and anvil step properties are aggregated over each month of observation, and overall core and anvil properties are calculated.
During this final step quality flagging is performed to isolate detected features that fail one or more quality checks.
The quality criteria are split into two criteria.
The first set of criteria---for core or anvil removal---removes detected features which should not pass the criteria for detection in the first place.
Detected features which flag any of these criteria are removed from the aggregated dataset in their entirety.
This step in particular removes anvils which have no cores associated with them, or are not detected as initiating with a developing core.

The second set of criteria is used to identify detected cores or anvils for which we do not observe their entire extent or lifecycle.
Cores and anvils which flag are of these criteria are still included within the aggregated properties dataset, but are not used when investigating \acrshort{dcc} properties throughout this chapter.

Quality criteria for cores are listed in table \ref{table:core_validity_criteria}, and those for anvils in tabel \ref{table:anvil_validity_criteria}.

The complete processing pathway is outlined by the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Detection of cores and anvils in \acrshort{abi} observations over each 24-hour period.
    \item Linking of overlapping objects detected in subsequent 24-hour periods over each month.
    \item Calculation of core and anvil step properties. 
    \item Quality criteria applied to core and anvils, properties aggregated over each month
\end{enumerate}

Two datasets are produced. The first consists of daily core and anvil spatial maps, with step properties, produced by processing step 3. 
The second, consisting of aggregated monthly core and anvil properties, is produced by step 4.

% \section{A novel method for detecting deep convective cloud cores and their associated anvils in geostationary satellite imagery}

% Numerous algorithms have been developed for the purpose of automatically detecting and tracking \acrshort{dcc}s, and are widely used for both forecasting and research purposes \citep[e.g.][]{mecikalski_use_2011, senf_characterization_2015, senf_satellite-based_2017, feng_life_2012, feng_spatiotemporal_2019, zinner_cb-tram:_2008}.
% Development of these algorithms has seen constant and continuous efforts.
% However a number of difficulties must be taken into account when utilising geostationary satellite imagery to detect and track \acrshort{dcc}s compared to the use of radar or lightning observations.


% Figure \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm} provides an example of how geostationary satellite imagery compares to observations of \acrshort{dcc}s using ground-based cloud radar and lightning observations.
% In fig. \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}a, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}d, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}g and \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}e, we see how a growing \acrshort{dcc} is observed by visible/near infrared (NIR) satellite imagery, 10.4\,\unit{\mu m} longwave (LW) infrared (IR) satellite imagery, lightning flash observations from a satellite instrument and column radar reflectivity respectively.
% Figures \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}b, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}e, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}h and \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}k show observations of a mature \acrshort{dcc}, and \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}c, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}f, \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}i and \ref{fig:compare_sat_radar_glm}l show those of a dissipating \acrshort{dcc}.
% While lightning and radar observations are capable of detecting deep convection in the growing and mature phase of \acrshort{dcc}s, neither can detect either the full extent of the anvil cloud or the dissipating phase of the \acrshort{dcc}.
% The ability to detect and track the anvil cloud over its entire lifetime is important to study the anvil cloud radiative forcing on the climate, the response to temperature change \citep{bony_thermodynamic_2016, hartmann_tropical_2016, ceppi_cloud_2017, gasparini_what_2019} and possible feedbacks on subsequent convective activity \citep{varble_erroneous_2018}.
% However, while radar and lightning observations of \acrshort{dcc}s can directly detect deep convection due to the strong correlations between core updraft intensity and radar reflectivity and polarisation \citep{austin_relation_1987, rosenfeld_general_1993, zipser_vertical_1994},  and lightning flash occurrence \citep{williams_relationship_1989, deierling_total_2008, wang_relationship_2017}, the same is not possible for geostationary satellite observations.
% Instead, a proxy variable linked to convective activity must be used to detect \acrshort{dcc}s.

% There are, in general, two approaches used as proxies for detecting convective clouds in geostationary satellite imagery. 
% Firstly, thresholds on observed field -- in particular LW IR brightness temperature (BT) -- are capable of detecting \acrshort{dcc} anvil clouds \citep[e.g.][]{schmetz_monitoring_1997, hong_detection_2005, schroder_deep_2009, liang_integrated_2017, senf_size-resolved_2018}.
% Secondly, the early stages of \acrshort{dcc}s can be detected using cloud top cooling rates \citep{zinner_cb-tram:_2008, bedka_objective_2010, muller_novel_2019}.
% The latter method is typically used for early detection of \acrshort{dcc}s for forecasting systems, as cloud top growth can detect \acrshort{dcc}s prior to radar observations \citep{roberts_nowcasting_2003}.
% While such algorithms provide an accurate detection of these early phases of \acrshort{dcc} growth \citep{zinner_validation_2013}, as the cooling of the cloud top is only visible during the initial phase of the \acrshort{dcc} any method that solely relies on detecting the growth of the \acrshort{dcc} will be unable to detect the anvil cloud after this initial growth phase has ended.

% On the other hand, threshold-based methods are better capable of detecting \acrshort{dcc}s throughout the mature phase, however are less able to detect the early stages of \acrshort{dcc} growth due to the inability to distinguish warm, growing \acrshort{dcc}s from other warm clouds.
% Furthermore, the choice of threshold value presents a limitation to the accuracy of threshold based detection methods.
% A choice of a warmer BT threshold results in false detections of non-convective clouds, whereas a colder threshold results in missed detections of \acrshort{dcc}s which do not meet the threshold, and further reduces the period over which \acrshort{dcc}s are detected.
% As the distributions of cloud top temperature for \acrshort{dcc}s and non-convective clouds overlap \citep{so_classification_2018}, there is no ideal threshold value that avoids this issue.
% \citet{fiolleau_algorithm_2013} implemented a single-step framework for detecting and tracking MCSs that aims to address the compromise in detection accuracy by allowing a \acrshort{dcc} that is detected above a cold threshold BT at any time-step to be detected and tracked across the rest of its lifetime using a warmer threshold.
% Whereas this approach is successful for large, mesoscale systems, where the advection of the anvil is small compared to the over anvil area, it is less suitable for tracking small, rapidly moving convective cores due to the overlap between the spacing of neighbouring \acrshort{dcc} cores and the typical distance moved by cores between time steps \citep{heikenfeld_tobac_2019}.
% To improve the tracking of small \acrshort{dcc}s, we have developed a novel method which uses semi-Lagrangian framework for single-step detection and tracking which accounts for the motion of \acrshort{dcc}s using optical flow.
% This method allows us to first detect growing \acrshort{dcc} cores using a growth-based detection method, and then detect their associated anvil clouds even after growth is no longer detected.
% This method allows new capabilities in detected \acrshort{dcc}s over their entire lifecycles.

% \subsection{Overview of detection and tracking method}

% We present here an overview of the detection and tracking method presented in \citet{jones_semi-lagrangian_2022}.
% This method can be outlined in the following steps:

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Ingest of LW IR BT fields from geostationary satellite imagery, and calculation of water vapour difference (WVD) and split window difference (SWD) fields.
%     \item Calculation of optical flow vectors to be used as an \textit{a priori} estimate of cloud motion for use in the semi-lagangian framework.
%     \item Detection of growing \acrshort{dcc} cores using cloud top cooling rate.
%     \item Detection of thick and thin anvil clouds associated with detected cores using a semi-lagrangian "3d" watershedding method. 
%     \item Grouping of cores into multi-core systems, calculation of statistics and validation using lightning observations.
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Data}

% The Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI), a radiometer aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-16 weather satellite \citep{schmit_closer_2016}, provides visible and IR imagery at a nadir resolution of 2\,\unit{km} or better, at intervals between 10 minutes to 30 seconds \citep{schmit_chapter_2020}.
% Situated in a geostationary orbit at 75.2°W above the equator, GOES-16 observes all of South America and most of North America.
% The combination of high spatial and temporal resolution makes ABI suitable for detecting and tracking small and developing \acrshort{dcc}s, as well as providing the spatial coverage to also track large mesoscale convective systems \citep{heikenfeld_tobac_2019}.
% In addition, the better signal to noise ratio of ABI observations compared to previous geostationary imaging instruments \citep{iacovazzi_goes-16_2020}, combined with many of the channels being derived from those aboard the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), make the data from ABI better suited for research purposes than that from older instruments \citep{heidinger_chapter_2020}.

% In this paper we have used the ABI level 2 multi-channel cloud and moisture imagery product (MCMIP) over the continental US domain \citep{schmit_chapter_2020}.
% This product consists of calibrated reflectances and brightness temperatures on a common grid.
% All data has been sourced through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Big Data Program.

% In order to have equal performance during both day and nighttime, a selection of longwave IR ABI channels are used for the detection and tracking of \acrshort{dcc}s (see figure \ref{fig:abi_channels}). 
% These channels consist of the LW clean and dirty window channels at 10.4\,\unit{\mu m} and 12.4\,\unit{\mu m} respectively, and the upper and lower troposphere water vapour channels at 6.2\,\unit{\mu m} and 7.3\,\unit{\mu m} respectively.
% Whereas the LW window IR brightness temperature is commonly used for the detection of \acrshort{dcc}s, we have decided not to use it for this purpose in this method due to the wide range of brightness temperatures observed within anvil clouds, and the variance of anvil cloud temperature because of changes in tropopause temperature due to meteorology and latitude.
% However, the information contained within this field is used to for the optical flow calculation of the cloud motion field.

% Two additional combinations of channels are used to detect areas of deep convective cloud anvil. 
% The water vapour difference (WVD) combination (figure \ref{fig:abi_channels}b) of the upper troposphere WV channel minus the lower troposphere WV channel has been shown to provide a high detection rate for deep convective clouds \citep{muller_role_2018, muller_novel_2019}.
% In clear sky or low cloud conditions, WVD shows the temperature difference between the upper and lower troposphere of generally around -20 K. 
% However, in the presence of high, thick clouds the 6.2\,\unit{\mu m} has an additional contribution from stratospheric water vapour produces a warm, and in extreme cases positive WVD value \citep{schmetz_monitoring_1997}.
% This provides clear distinction between thick, high cloud and other clouds, with the cutoff value of -5 °C giving a high detection rate of anvil clouds \citep{muller_novel_2019}. 
% Furthermore, as the WVD values are relative to the lower stratosphere temperatures, this field is much less affected by location and meteorology than the LW IR channel.
% However, the WVD is still prone to the false detections of non-convective clouds when using a thresholding method.

% The split window difference (SWD) (figure \ref{fig:abi_channels}c) (the clean IR window channel minus the dirty IR window channel) aids in the detection and separation of optically thin anvil cloud (including cirrus outflow) from optically thick anvil due to the difference in ice particle emissivity between these two channels \citep{heidinger_gazing_2009}.
% As a result, this combination displays warm temperatures of around 10\,\unit{K} for thin, ice clouds, near 0\,\unit{K} for thick clouds, and approximately 5\,\unit{K} for clear skies due to the contribution of boundary layer water vapour.
% The SWD is, however, also sensitive to low level clouds and low level water vapour concentrations, and so cannot be used alone to detect \acrshort{dcc}s.
% The SWD field is useful, however, due to the difficulty in separating anvil clouds from cirrus when using LW IR BT alone \citep{hong_detection_2005}. 
% By subtracting the SWD from the WVD field, we can reduce the sensitivity of our detection scheme to cirrus clouds, reducing the rate of erroneous detections.
% Further, adding the SWD field to WVD field can enhance the appearance of cirrus, enabling the detection of cirrus outflow  from \acrshort{dcc} anvils.

% \subsection{Classification of \acrshort{dcc} cores and anvils}

% The detection and classification of \acrshort{dcc}s occurs over three steps.
% First, the cores are detected using regions of cooling cloud top BT.
% \citet{roberts_nowcasting_2003} identified cloud top cooling rates of between 4 and 8\,\unit{K} over a 15 minute period as being associated with weak convection, and greater than 8\,\unit{K} as associated with more intense convective development.
% Here we use corresponding threshold values of 0.25 and 0.5\,\unit{K minute\textsuperscript{-1}} respectively to detect developing deep convective cores.
% If we assume that the cloud top temperature of a growing \acrshort{dcc} core follows the moist pseudo-adiabat then this upper bound is equivalent to a cloud top vertical velocity of approximately 1.5\,\unit{ms\textsuperscript{-1}}.
% It should be made clear that this is not the same as the vertical velocity of the updraft within the core, and it is expected that the cloud top growth will be slower due to the impacts of entrainment on the growing cloud.

% A core is defined as a region of continuous cooling BT exceeding 0.25\,\unit{K minute\textsuperscript{-1}}, with at least one time step with as cooling rate greater than 0.5\,\unit{K minute\textsuperscript{-1}}.
% Several further constraints are applied to the detection of growing cores.
% First, a core must exist for at least 15 minutes.
% Secondly, the core must reach a WVD of greater than -5\,\unit{K}, the criteria used by \citet{muller_role_2018} to detect high, thick clouds.
% The challenge of detecting changes in BT due to vertical cloud growth, rather than that due to horizontal motion or growth of the anvil cloud \citep{hartung_intercomparison_2013}, is handled by using the semi-lagrangian framework to account for cloud motion when calculating the change in BT over time.
% Furthermore, a curvature filter is used to isolate growth only in regions that display a peak of cold BT, in order to prevent erroneous detections of cloud growth in regions where multiple clouds and merging together.
% When calculating the BT cooling rate, the WVD field, rather than LW IR window BT, is used as this is only sensitive to mid- and upper-level growth associated with deep convection.

% Following core detection, the associated anvil cloud is detected using a "3d" watershed approach in the same manner as \citet{fiolleau_algorithm_2013}.
% Rather than use BT thresholds for detecting the anvil cloud, we use the detected core regions as the seed for the watershedding, and use an edge detection method to detect the extent of the anvil cloud as used by \citet{dim_alternative_2013}.
% By using the detected core regions as the initial seed for the watershed segmentation, we only detect anvil clouds that are associated with detected regions of convective growth.
% Utilising the semi-Lagrangian scheme to account for cloud motion, we can apply the "3d" watershedding method to cases of small, rapidly moving cores and anvils where previously this approach would not be applicable.
% Use of the edge detection method allows us to avoid the use of a fixed threshold and instead detect the full extent of the anvil cloud while avoiding the challenges of warm BT thresholds previously discussed.
% To detect the region of thick anvil cloud associated with cores, the edge detection method is applied to the WVD field minus the SWD field (to remove thin cirrus), with edges detected in the range of -5 and -15\,\unit{K}.
% A detected thick anvil cloud may be associated with multiple cores, allowing us to detect cases where the multiple \acrshort{dcc}s have merged into one.
% Finally, we detect the thin anvil region -- including cirrus outflow -- by repeating the procedure for detecting the thick anvils but instead using the WVD field plus the SWD field for edge detection.
% This allows us to detect thin, high level clouds that are associated with detected cores and anvils without detecting isolated cirrus.

% Figure \ref{fig:detected_anvils} shows an example of the results of detecting and tracking \acrshort{dcc} cores and their associated anvils.
% Detection of the cores (outlined in red) and the initial development of the associated anvils (outlined in orange and blue for the thick and thin anvil regions respectively) can be seen in figure \ref{fig:detected_anvils}a.
% In figure \ref{fig:detected_anvils}b we see the development of the mature anvil, which primarily consists of thick anvil, and secondary core detections as new convection develops at the edge of the \acrshort{dcc}.
% In figure \ref{fig:detected_anvils}c, we see the detected anvil cloud begin to dissipate, with a larger proportion of the anvil cloud detected as thin anvil.
% It should be noted that the algorithm is capable of tracking both individual cores and their associated anvil clouds, including when multiple cores feed into a single anvil.
% Furthermore, the anvil cloud and the outflow region continue to be tracked after growing cores can no longer be detected.

% In this study, we have generated a dataset of detected cores and their associated anvil clouds for a subset of the GOES-16 CONUS region spanning from 114 to 76\textdegree~W and from 24 to 45\textdegree~N, an area of approximately 2,500 by 1,875\,\unit{km}, for the entirety of the year 2018.
% Days were excluded from the dataset when there were periods of missing data exceeding 15~minutes or when anomalies in the ABI data that may have affected core or anvil detection were present.
% In total, this removed 35~days, resulting in the remaining dataset covering 330~days of 2018.

% In total, over the course of 2018, we detected 80,644 unique cores and 22,526 unique anvils.
% Of these, 1,592 cores and 7,992 anvils were detected intersecting the edge of the domain and have been removed from analysis of the properties and lifetimes of cores and anvils to avoid incomplete data.
% Due to technical limitations for processing the long time series of data, no anvils are detected with a lifetime of over 24~hours.
% We plan in future to address this issue in order to detect long lived \acrshort{dcc}s.

    \label{fig:core_density_by_season}
\end{figure}

To begin, we investigate the distribution of detected \acrshort{dcc} cores throughout the dataset.
In fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season} we plot the distribution of observed cores over North America separated by season.
Large variations in the spatial distribution of cores can be observed across the different seasons.
Overall, in winter and spring (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,a,b) we see lower rates of the observed \acrshort{dcc}s than in the summer and autumn (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,c,d).

In winter (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,a) the majority of convection observed occurs over the ocean, particularly in the areas of the Gulf of Mexico and West Atlantic associated with warm currents.
In spring (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,b) we see a similar pattern over ocean, however there is also an increase in convection detected over land in the Caribbean, Mexico and the central and southern United States.
In summer (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,c) we a large increase in convection over land and ocean, with the highest rates of convection of any season.
In particular we see high rates of convection over Mexico, the Caribbean, the southern United States (Florida in particular) and adjacent ocean regions.
In Autumn (fig.~\ref{fig:core_density_by_season}\,d), we see a large reduction in the number of convective cores detected over land regions.
The number of detections over the ocean remains high however, indicating a possible lag in the seasonal cycle of convection over oceans compared to that over land.

Figure~\ref{fig:cores_with_anvils_map} shows the proportion of cores associated with anvil clouds.

\end{figure}

In fig.~\ref{fig:core_detection_time_map}, we show the mean time of detection for cores detected within each 1-degree grid square.
The most notable feature in fig.~\ref{fig:core_detection_time_map} is the strong land-sea contrast, with the majority of land regions showing convective activity occurring during the afternoon, and the majority of ocean regions showing activity before midday.
In addition, we see a few major features of the detected time of initiation across both land and sea regions.

In coastal regions in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, we see earlier initiation times closer to coastlines, while regions further from land have average times of detection closer to midday.


Over the land, we see a later time of initiation over the Northern Great Plains (90--100\,\textdegree W, 37--47\,\textdegree N).

Figure~\ref{fig:core_propagation_map} shows the average speed of propagation for cores observed in each 1-degree grid box, with the average direction of propagation shown by arrows for each 2-degree grid box.
We see a clear change in the direction of propagation from an easterly motion in the tropics (below 25\,\textdegree N) to a westerly motion in the mid-latitudes.


In the following two figures (fig.~\ref{fig:core_lifetime_map} and \ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_map} we only map the properties of cores which initiate with an average brightness temperature of greater than 273\,\unit{K}.
This is done to show the average properties of cores which we observe developing in clear sky or low cloud conditions, and exclude those which form within existing anvil clouds.
This shows where we expect to observe the full lifetime of the observed core.

Figure \ref{fig:core_lifetime_map} displays the mean lifetime of observed cores over each 1-degree box of latitude and longitude.
We see a contrast between land and sea, with cores occurring over the ocean having a shorter lifetime, and an increase in the average core duration over the Great Plains region.

Figure~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_map} shows the average cooling rate of observed cores.
Some contrast is seen again between land and sea, particularly in the Caribbean, but this is less pronounced than the difference in lifetime shown in fig.~\ref{fig:core_lifetime_map}.



Figure~\ref{fig:core_properties} shows the distributions of lifetime (fig.~\ref{fig:core_properties}\,a), maximum area (fig.~\ref{fig:core_properties}\,b), cooling rate (fig.~\ref{fig:core_properties}\,c) and minimum \acrshort{bt} (fig.~\ref{fig:core_properties}\,d).
The hatched areas show the distributions of cores with warm initial \acrshort{bt}.
In general, cores observed with warm initial \acrshort{bt} tend to have longer lifetimes and greater cooling rates.
However, they also tend to have smaller maximum areas and warmer minimum \acrshort{bt}, indicating that cores observed forming within existing anvil clouds tend to have both larger areas and colder \acrshort{bt}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}\,a compares how the average lifetime of detected cores changes with their maximum observed cooling rate.
For low values of core cooling rate, we see a similar, positive linear relationship between cooling rate and lifetime between all regions, indicating that more intense convection leads to longer periods of cores being observed.
However, beyond cooling rates of around 1.5\,\unit{K minute\textsuperscript{-1}} we see an inflexion in the relationship, with larger cooling rates leading to shorter lifetimes.
This may be explained by the cores with faster cooling rates reaching their level of neutral buoyancy faster, and therefore showing cooling cloud tops for a shorter period of time.

    }
    \label{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}\,b shows how the minimum \acrshort{bt} changes with the maximum cooling rate of the core.
Unlike fig.~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}\,a, we see a continuous decrease in \acrshort{bt} with core cooling rate, indicating that faster cooling rates tend to result in cores with colder \acrshort{ctt} and hence higher \acrshort{cth}.
Figure~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}\,b also provides context for the results seen in fig.~\ref{fig:core_cooling_rate_relations}\,a.
If we assume that cores are detected around the freezing level (273\,\unit{K}), then we see that the overall temperature change over the core lifetime ranges from $\sim$45\,\unit{K} for the least intense cores to $\sim$65\,\unit{K} for the most intense cores.
Although this continues to increase with cooling rate, the proportional change is less than that of the core cooling rate itself.
As we can approximate the core lifetime as the core \acrshort{bt} change divided by the cooling rate, the larger proportional change in cooling rate will result in a shorter lifetime for more rapidly cooling cores.

    }
    \label{fig:core_area_relations}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:core_area_relations} shows how core properties change with the maximum area of the core.
Core area is important for core development, as it influences the amount of entrainment of surrounding air during the growth of the core.
This entrainment has a greater effect on cores with smaller area, and may reduce the maximum height of the core.
We see an increase in average core cooling rate (fig.~\ref{fig:core_area_relations}\,a) and a decrease in minimum \acrshort{bt} (fig.~\ref{fig:core_area_relations}\,b) with core maximum area up to areas of around 250\,\unit{km}, indicating an increase in core growth with increasing area.
Beyond this, however, we see a decrease in cooling rates and an increase in minimum \acrshort{bt} with increasing area, indicating a weakening of convective growth.
It is possible that for these very large regions of growing \acrshort{dcc}, we see a dilution in the vertical ascent due to it being spread over such a large area.
% In fig. \ref{fig:sea_breeze_effect} we explicitly show this relationship by plotting the mean time of core detection against distance from the coast.
% We see a clear trend towards an earlier time of detection as the distance to the coast reduces, indicative of a sea breeze effect.
% The maximum extent of the sea breeze effect extends to between approximately 200\,\unit{km}, similar to the extent of the sea breeze effect quantified using models over the Congo \citep{park_environmental_2020}.

% To further investigate the differences in observed core properties across North America, we classify observed cores into four regions shown in fig. \ref{fig:regions}.
% These four regions were selected due to the observed behaviours of cores seen in previous figures.
% The ocean region contains all cores detected over the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean and the Western Atlantic.
% The coastal region is defined as the areas within 250~km of the ocean region, chosen to investigate the sea-breeze affected areas demonstrated by fig. \ref{fig:sea_breeze_effect}.
% The inland areas are further divided into two regions.

% Secondly, the Midwest, in contrast to the Great Plains region, represents more typical over-land convection seen in the dataset.

%     \label{fig:regional_tod}
% \end{figure}

% Figure \ref{fig:regional_tod} shows the distributions of time of day of detection for cores observed within each of the regions shown in fig. \ref{fig:regions}.
% The distributions of initiation time for cores over the ocean show a noticeably different distribution to those over land.
% The diurnal variation over the ocean is much weaker, however there is still a peak in the morning (and a corresponding low point in the evening) as seen by the average time of initiation in fig. \ref{fig:regional_tod}, which is again explained due to convective initiation being triggered by night-time cooling of the upper atmosphere through longwave emissions.

% Over land, we see the highest frequency of cores detected in the coastal region, agreeing with the distributions shown in fig. \ref{fig:core_density_by_season}.
% In addition, we see an earlier maximum in the diurnal cycle of 13:00-14:00, compared to that of the Midwest and Great Plains regions of 14:00-15:00.
% This agrees with the impact of the sea breeze shown in fig. \ref{fig:sea_breeze_effect}.

% Comparing the diurnal cycle of core detection between the Midwest and Great Plains region, we see that the Great Plains region shows a greater frequency of detected cores outside of the peak time period in the afternoon.
% In particular, we see increased rates of core detection in the early evening compared to the Midwest region, which is possibly indicative of the bimodal diurnal cycle of deep convection seen previously over the northern great plains \citep{feng_spatiotemporal_2019, li_high-resolution_2021}.

% The distribution of core cooling rates again shows little difference between each region, however there is a more noticeable increase in the frequency of higher cooling rates over the Great Plains, indicative of more intense convection in the region.

\subsection{Distributions and properties of observed anvil clouds}

By tracking the anvils associated with detected cores, we can investigate the differences in the properties of anvil clouds in response to changes in the cores.
Figure \ref{fig:multicore_frequency} show the frequency of anvil clouds detected with different numbers of cores.
We observe that the majority of anvils form from a single core, with a continuous decay in the number of anvils observed with an increasing number of cores.
It should be noted however, that as we are detecting cores through observing regions of cooling cloud top temperatures, it is harder to detect cores within mature anvils and as a result we may underestimate the number of cores in larger systems.

Figure \ref{fig:multicore_fraction_map} shows the fraction of anvils detected that are associated with more than one core in each 1x1 degree grid square.
There is a noticeable increase in the fraction of multi-core anvils with increasing latitude.
This is possibly due to the greater influence of large-scale forcing such as the jet stream as we move further from the tropics.

Figures \ref{fig:anvil_lifetime_by_core} and \ref{fig:thin_anvil_lifetime_by_core} show how the average lifetime of observed anvil clouds varies depending on the number of cores associated with each anvil.
In both cases, we observe the lifetime of the anvil to increase with the number of cores.
In general, anvils observed over land have longer lifetimes than those over the coast and ocean.

%     \label{fig:anvil_lifetime_by_core}
% \end{figure}

Of particular note in fig. \ref{fig:anvil_lifetime_by_core} is the Great Plains region.
Single-core anvils in this region have short lifetimes similar to those of anvils over the ocean and coast.
However, the lifetime of anvils over the Great Plains increases more rapidly with the number of cores compared to other regions, and it displays longer lifetimes for multi-core anvils than other regions, potentially indicating greater dynamical interactions.
In fig. \ref{fig:thin_anvil_lifetime_by_core}, however, we observe that in the Great Plains region the lifetime of the thin anvil cloud for single-core \acrshort{dcc}s is similar to those in the Midwest.
This indicates that anvils in the Great Plains region have a longer dissipating phase than those of other regions.
It should also be noted that no significant differences in average core lifetime or growth rates are found for the cores observed associates with multi-core and single-core anvils, so these differences in the anvil behaviour are due to the interactions between multiple cores, not the individual differences in the cores.

\section{Conclusions}  %% \conclusions[modified heading if necessary]

By producing the first continental scale dataset of both \acrshort{dcc} cores and anvils, we are able to analyse a large number of detected deep convective systems.
We have been able to show a number of key differences in the seasonal, diurnal and regional patterns of \acrshort{dcc}s across the continental US.
The spatial distribution of \acrshort{dcc} cores across the continental US depends strongly on the seasonal cycle.
The properties of cores themselves, including the lifetime, cooling rate, and time of initiation, have regional dependencies.
We see a large land/sea contrast in time of initiation, and a sea breeze effect which extends for approximately 200\,\unit{km} inland.
In addition, we see differences in the distribution of core time of detection between the two inland regions -- the Midwest and the Great Plains -- with the Great Plains showing a greater spread of convection throughout the night time.
In addition, the Great Plains region shows increased core cooling rates and lifetimes compared to other regions, both of which are associated with more intense convection.
It may be the case that this later time of initiation results in more intense deep convective storms.
The distribution of lifetimes of observed cores shows less difference between different regions, indicating that a number of competing factors may be controlling this property.

While the majority of observed anvil clouds are associated with a single growing core, there remain a large number of multi-core anvils detected in our dataset.
The frequency of multi-core anvils as a proportion of all observed anvils increases with latitude.
Finally, while the properties of the individual growing cores observed in single- and multi-core anvils show no significant difference, the lifetime of anvils clouds shows a large increase with the number of cores.
In addition, the extended lifetime of the thin anvil cloud compared to that of the thick anvil over the Great Plains region may be evidence of the impact of the intensity of convection on the dissipating phase of the \acrshort{dcc}.

Overall, a number of competing factors influence the properties of both \acrshort{dcc} cores and anvils, including the seasonal and diurnal cycles, region, and the number of cores associated with each anvil.
These factors require careful consideration when investigating the response of deep convection to external influences.
Future work will focus on connecting the behaviour of observed \acrshort{dcc}s to meteorological changes including surface temperature, humidity, CAPE and CIN, as well as the impact of aerosols on \acrshort{dcc}s.
Furthermore, we will quantify to radiative impacts of anvil clouds across their lifecycle, and aim to investigate the feedbacks of these radiative effects on subsequent convection.
