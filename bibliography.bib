Taking advantage of recent tracking techniques, this study investigates the evolution of macrophysical, microphysical, and radiative properties over the MCS life cycle by merging geostationary and polar-orbiting satellite data. These observations are performed in three major convective areas: continental West Africa, the adjacent Atlantic Ocean, and the open Indian Ocean. MCS properties are also investigated according to internal subregions (convective, stratiform, and nonprecipitating anvil). Continental MCSs show a specific life cycle, with more intense convection at the beginning. Larger and denser hydrometeors are thus found at higher altitudes, as well as up to the cirriform subregion. Oceanic MCSs have more constant reflectivity values, suggesting a less intense convective updraft, but more persistent intensity. A layer of small crystals is found in all subregions, but with a depth that varies according to the MCS subregion and life cycle. Radiative properties are also examined. It appears that the evolution of large and dense hydrometeors tends to control the evolution of the cloud albedo and the outgoing longwave radiation. The impact of dense hydrometeors, detrained from the convective towers, is also seen in the radiative heating profiles, in particular in the shortwave domain. A dipole of cooling near the cloud top and heating near the cloud base is found in the longwave; this cooling intensifies near the end of the life cycle.},

The MCS life cycle is documented using a tracking algorithm. A composite approach is then implemented to document the evolution of radiative properties at each life stage at the scale of the tropical belt, in continental and oceanic regions and in specific regions. Independently of the considered region, the composites share similarities with a unique maximum in albedo and a unique minimum in OLR, values of which differ depending on the environment as well as the amplitude of both parameters over the life cycle. The unique precessing orbit of the Megha-Tropiques satellite allows a consideration of the albedo as a function of the local time of observation showing that the magnitude of the albedo signal is mainly controlled by the solar zenithal angle. Sensitivity tests make possible the quantification of the impact of an error in radiative properties showing that even small errors lead to substantial increment on the instantaneous cloud radiative effect. All together, these elements point toward the subtle balance between life cycle, cloud radiative properties, and phasing within the diurnal cycle to build the atmospheric radiative budget in oceanic or continental regions.},

Deep convective clouds (DCCs) are associated with a mean radiative forcing relative to non–deep convective areas of −39 W m−2 over the Atlantic Ocean and of +13 W m−2 over equatorial Africa (±10 W m−2 in both cases). We show that over land the timing of the daily cycle of convection relative to the daily cycle in solar illumination and surface temperature significantly affects the mean radiative forcing by DCCs. Displacement of the daily cycle of DCC coverage by 2 hours changes their overall radiative effect by ∼10 W m−2, with implications for the simulation of the radiative balance in this region. The timing of the minimum DCC cover over land, close to noon local time, means that the mean radiative forcing is nearly maximized.},

	abstract = {Abstract Common assumptions in temperature lapse rate formulas for lifted air parcels include neglecting mixing, hydrostatic balance, the removal of all condensate once it forms (pseudoadiabatic), and/or the retention of all condensate within the parcel (adiabatic). These formulas are commonly derived from the conservation of entropy, which leads to errors when nonequilibrium mixed-phase condensate is present. To evaluate these assumptions, a new general lapse rate formula is derived from an expression for energy conservation, rather than entropy conservation. This new formula incorporates mixing of the parcel with its surroundings, relaxes the hydrostatic assumption, allows for nonequilibrium mixed-phase condensate, and can be formulated for pseudoadiabatic or adiabatic ascent. The new formula is shown to exactly conserve entropy for reversible ascent. Predictions by the new formula are compared to that of older and less general formulas. The errors in previous formulas arise from the assumption of hydrostatic balance, which results in considerable warm biases due to the neglect of the energy sink from buoyancy. Predictions of ascent with entrainment using the new formula are then compared to parcel properties along trajectories in large eddy simulations. Simulated parcel properties are better predicted by the formula using a diluted analogy to adiabatic ascent, wherein condensate is diluted at the same rate as other parcel properties, than by the diluted analogy to pseudoadiabatic ascent, wherein all condensate is removed. These results suggest that CAPE should be computed with adiabatic, rather than pseudoadiabatic, parcel ascent.},

Here, it is shown that the true conserved variable for this process is MSE minus convective available potential energy (CAPE) calculated as the integral of buoyancy from the parcel’s height to its level of neutral buoyancy and that this variable is conserved even when accounting for full moist thermodynamics and nonhydrostatic pressure forces. In the calculation of a dry convecting parcel, conservation of MSE minus CAPE gives the same answer as conservation of entropy and potential temperature, while the use of MSE alone can generate large errors. For a moist parcel, entropy and equivalent potential temperature give the same answer as MSE minus CAPE only if the parcel ascends in thermodynamic equilibrium. If the parcel ascends with a nonisothermal mixed-phase stage, these methods can give significantly different answers for the parcel buoyancy because MSE minus CAPE is conserved, while entropy and equivalent potential temperature are not.},

	abstract = {Abstract It is often assumed in parcel theory calculations, numerical models, and cumulus parameterizations that moist static energy (MSE) is adiabatically conserved. However, the adiabatic conservation of MSE is only approximate because of the assumption of hydrostatic balance. Two alternative variables are evaluated here: MSE − IB and MSE + KE, wherein IB is the path integral of buoyancy (B) and KE is kinetic energy. Both of these variables relax the hydrostatic assumption and are more precisely conserved than MSE. This article quantifies the errors that result from assuming that the aforementioned variables are conserved in large-eddy simulations (LES) of both disorganized and organized deep convection. Results show that both MSE − IB and MSE + KE better predict quantities along trajectories than MSE alone. MSE − IB is better conserved in isolated deep convection, whereas MSE − IB and MSE + KE perform comparably in squall-line simulations. These results are explained by differences between the pressure perturbation behavior of squall lines and isolated convection. Errors in updraft B diagnoses are universally minimized when MSE − IB is assumed to be adiabatically conserved, but only when moisture dependencies of heat capacity and temperature dependency of latent heating are accounted for. When less accurate latent heat and heat capacity formulae were used, MSE − IB yielded poorer B predictions than MSE due to compensating errors. Our results suggest that various applications would benefit from using either MSE − IB or MSE + KE instead of MSE with properly formulated heat capacities and latent heats.},

	abstract = {This study revisits an old concept in meteorology - level of neutral buoyancy (LNB). The classic definition of LNB is derived from the parcel theory and can be estimated from the ambient sounding (LNB\_sounding) without having to observe any actual convective cloud development. In reality, however, convection interacts with the environment in complicated ways; it will eventually manage to find its own effective LNB and manifests it through detraining masses and developing anvils (LNB\_observation). This study conducts a near-global survey of LNB\_observation for tropical deep convection using CloudSat data and makes comparison with the corresponding LNB\_sounding. The principal findings are as follows: First, although LNB\_sounding provides a reasonable upper bound for convective development, correlation between LNB\_sounding and LNB\_observation is low suggesting that ambient sounding contains limited information for accurately predicting the actual LNB. Second, maximum mass outflow is located more than 3 km lower than LNB\_sounding. Hence, from convective transport perspective, LNB\_sounding is a significant overestimate of the “destination” height level of the detrained mass. Third, LNB\_observation is consistently higher over land than over ocean, although LNB\_sounding is similar between land and ocean. This difference is likely related to the contrasts in convective strength and environment between land and ocean. Finally, we estimate the bulk entrainment rates associated with the observed deep convection, which can serve as an observational basis for adjusting GCM cumulus parameterization.},

	abstract = {Abstracts The history of severe thunderstorm research and forecasting over the past century has been a remarkable story involving interactions between technological development of observational and modeling capabilities, research into physical processes, and the forecasting of phenomena with the goal of reducing loss of life and property. Perhaps more so than any other field of meteorology, the relationship between researchers and forecasters has been particularly close in the severe thunderstorm domain, with both groups depending on improved observational capabilities. The advances that have been made have depended on observing systems that did not exist 100 years ago, particularly radar and upper-air systems. They have allowed scientists to observe storm behavior and structure and the environmental setting in which storms occur. This has led to improved understanding of processes, which in turn has allowed forecasters to use those same observational systems to improve forecasts. Because of the relatively rare and small-scale nature of many severe thunderstorm events, severe thunderstorm researchers have developed mobile instrumentation capabilities that have allowed them to collect high-quality observations in the vicinity of storms. Since much of the world is subject to severe thunderstorm hazards, research has taken place around the world, with the local emphasis dependent on what threats are perceived in that area, subject to the availability of resources to study the threat. Frequently, the topics of interest depend upon a single event, or a small number of events, of a particular kind that aroused public or economic interests in that area. International cooperation has been an important contributor to collecting and disseminating knowledge. As the AMS turns 100, the range of research relating to severe thunderstorms is expanding. The time scale of forecasting or projecting is increasing, with work going on to study forecasts on the seasonal to subseasonal time scales, as well as addressing how climate change may influence severe thunderstorms. With its roots in studying weather that impacts the public, severe thunderstorm research now includes significant work from the social science community, some as standalone research and some in active collaborative efforts with physical scientists. In addition, the traditional emphases of the field continue to grow. Improved radar and numerical modeling capabilities allow meteorologists to see and model details that were unobservable and not understood a half century ago. The long tradition of collecting observations in the field has led to improved quality and quantity of observations, as well as the capability to collect them in locations that were previously inaccessible. Much of that work has been driven by the gaps in understanding identified by theoretical and operational practice.},

	abstract = {Abstract Using a passive tracer, entrainment is studied in cloud-resolving simulations of deep convection in radiative–convective equilibrium. It is found that the convective flux of undiluted parcels decays with height exponentially, indicating a constant probability per vertical distance of mixing with environmental air. This probability per distance is sufficiently large that undiluted updrafts are negligible above a height of 4–5 km and virtually absent above 10 km. These results are shown to be independent of the horizontal grid size within the range of 3.2 km to 100 m. Plumes that do reach the tropopause are found to be highly diluted. An equivalent potential temperature is defined that is exactly conserved for all reversible adiabatic transformations, including those with ice. Using this conserved variable, it is shown that the latent heat of fusion (from both freezing and deposition) causes only a small increase in the level of neutral buoyancy near the tropopause. In fact, when taken to sufficiently low pressures, a parcel with an ice phase ends up colder than it would without an ice phase. Nevertheless, the contribution from fusion to a parcel’s kinetic energy is quite large. Using an ensemble of tracers, information is encoded in parcels at the cloud base and decoded where the parcel is observed in the free troposphere. Using this technique, clouds at the tropopause are diagnosed for their cloud-base temperature, specific humidity, and vertical velocity. Using these as the initial values for a Lagrangian parcel model, it is shown that fusion provides the kinetic energy required for diluted parcels to reach the tropopause.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the effect of entrainment dilution on convective available potential energy (CAPE) and closure assumptions in convection parameterization using the sounding data from three Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs). It is shown that entrainment of the environmental air has a strong dilution effect on CAPE, and this effect depends on the degree of subsaturation of the entrained air: the drier the entrained air, the larger the effect. For CAPE-based closure assumptions, the dilute CAPE has a moderate correlation with convective removal of CAPE. While better than for undiluted CAPE, which is virtually uncorrelated with convective CAPE removal, this correlation is not satisfactory enough for convection closure. For quasi-equilibrium–based closures, while the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium assumption is a superior closure for convection when undiluted CAPE is used, both the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium closure and the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium closure work well for dilute CAPE in all three IOPs studied. It is further shown from the CAPE definition and the large-scale temperature budget equation that for undiluted CAPE, the free tropospheric large-scale CAPE change and precipitation are approximately linearly related. The most important effect of entrainment dilution on CAPE and convection parameterization closure assumptions is to enhance the role of free tropospheric humidity, thereby diminishing the overwhelming role of boundary layer control on undiluted CAPE and its variation.},

	abstract = {A new, satellite-based methodology is developed to evaluate convective mass flux and large-scale total mass flux. To derive the convective mass flux, candidate profiles of in-cloud vertical velocity are first constructed with a simple plume model under the constraint of ambient sounding and then narrowed down to the solution that matches satellite-derived cloud top buoyancy. Meanwhile, the large-scale total mass flux is provided separately from satellite soundings by a method developed previously. All satellite snapshots are sorted into a composite time series that delineates the evolution of a vigorous and organized convective system. Principal findings are the following. First, convective mass flux is modulated primarily by convective cloud cover, with the intensity of individual convection being less variable over time. Second, convective mass flux dominates the total mass flux only during the early hours of the convective evolution; as convective system matures, a residual mass flux builds up in the mass flux balance that is reminiscent of stratiform dynamics. The method developed in this study is expected to be of unique utility for future observational diagnosis of tropical convective dynamics and for evaluation of global climate model cumulus parameterizations in a global sense.},

The goal of the current study is to provide a more complete characterization of LNB, deep convective outflow, and convective core, and the relationship among them, as well as the dependence on environmental parameters and convective system size. A proxy is introduced to estimate convective entrainment, namely, the difference between the LNB (based on the ambient sounding) and the actual outflow height. The principal findings are as follows: (1) Deep convection over the Warm Pool has larger entrainment rates and smaller convective cores than the counterpart over the two tropical land regions (Africa and Amazonia), lending observational support to a long-standing assumption in convection models concerning the negative relationship between the two parameters. (2) The differences in internal vertical structure of convection between the two tropical land regions and the Warm Pool suggest that deep convection over the two tropical land regions contains more intense cores. (3) Deep convective outflow occurs at a higher level when the midtroposphere is more humid and the convective system size is smaller. The convective system size dependence is postulated to be related to convective lifecycle, highlighting the importance of cloud life stage information in interpretation of snapshot measurements by satellite. Finally, implications of the study to global modeling are discussed.},

	abstract = {Abstract Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are frequently observed over the U.S. Great Plains during boreal spring and summer. Here, four types of synoptically favorable environments for spring MCSs and two types each of synoptically favorable and unfavorable environments for summer MCSs are identified using self-organizing maps (SOMs) with inputs from observational data. During spring, frontal systems providing a lifting mechanism and an enhanced Great Plains low-level jet (GPLLJ) providing anomalous moisture are important features identified by SOM analysis for creating favorable dynamical and thermodynamic environments for MCS development. During summer, the composite MCS environment shows small positive convective available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) anomalies, which are in stark contrast with the large positive CAPE and negative CIN anomalies in spring. This contrast suggests that summer convection may occur even with weak large-scale dynamical and thermodynamic perturbations so MCSs may be inherently less predictable in summer. The two synoptically favorable environments identified in summer have frontal characteristics and an enhanced GPLLJ, but both shift north compared to spring. The two synoptically unfavorable environments feature enhanced upper-level ridges, but differ in the strength of the GPLLJ. In both seasons, MCS precipitation amount, area, and rate are much larger in the frontal-related MCSs than in nonfrontal MCSs. A large-scale index constructed using pattern correlation between large-scale environments and the synoptically favorable SOM types is found to be skillful for estimating MCS number, precipitation rate, and area in spring, but its explanatory power decreases significantly in summer. The low predictability of summer MCSs deserves further investigation in the future.},

	abstract = {Abstract Composite environments of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are produced from Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) analyses to explore the differences between rapidly and slowly developing MCSs as well as the differences ahead of long- and short-lived MCSs. The composite analyses capture the synoptic-scale features known to be associated with MCSs and depict the inertial oscillation of the nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ), which remains strong but tends to veer away from decaying MCSs. The composite first storms environment for the rapidly developing MCSs contains a stronger LLJ located closer to the first storms region, much more conditional instability, potential instability, and energy available for downdrafts, smaller 310-km vertical wind shear, and smaller geostrophic potential vorticity in the upper troposphere, when compared to the environment for the slowly developing MCSs. The weaker shear above 3 km for the rapidly developing MCSs is consistent with supercell or discrete cell modes being less likely in weaker deep-layer shear and the greater potential for a cold pool to trigger convection when the shear is confined to lower levels. Furthermore, these results suggest that low values of upper-level potential vorticity may signal a rapid transition to an MCS. The composite environment ahead of the genesis of long-lived MCSs contains a broader LLJ, a better-defined frontal zone, stronger low-level frontogenesis, deeper moisture, and stronger wind shear above 2 km, when compared to short-lived MCSs. The larger shear above 2 km for the long-lived MCSs is consistent with the importance of shear elevated above the ground to help organize and maintain convection that feeds on the elevated unstable parcels after dark and is indicative of the enhanced baroclinicity ahead of the MCSs.},

The authors review the wide range of past and current research dealing with the meteorological and climatological aspects of the North American monsoon, highlighting historical development and major research themes. The domain of the North American monsoon is large, extending over much of the western United States from its region of greatest influence in northwestern Mexico. Regarding the debate over moisture source regions and water vapor advection into southwestern North America, there is general agreement that the bulk of monsoon moisture is advected at low levels from the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of California, while the Gulf of Mexico may contribute some upper-level moisture (although mixing occurs over the Sierra Madre Occidental). Surges of low-level moisture from the Gulf of California are a significant part of intraseasonal monsoon variability, and they are associated with the configuration of upper-level midlatitude troughs and tropical easterly waves at the synoptic scale, as well as the presence of low-level jets, a thermal low, and associated dynamics (including the important effects of local topography) at the mesoscale. Seasonally, the gulf surges and the latitudinal position of the midtropospheric subtropical ridge over southwestern North America appear to be responsible for much spatial and temporal variability in precipitation. Interannual variability of the North American monsoon system is high, but it is not strongly linked to El Niño or other common sources of interannual circulation variability. Recent mesoscale field measurements gathered during the South-West Area Monsoon Project have highlighted the complex nature of the monsoon-related severe storm environment and associated difficulties in modeling and forecasting.},

	abstract = {Abstract Time series of seasonal-, monthly, and pentad-mean precipitation are subjected to empirical orthogonal function analysis, regression analysis, and compositing techniques to study the principal modes of interannual and intraseasonal variability of the North American Monsoon System (NAMS). The leading principal component (PC) from the summertime seasonal-mean data is associated with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability while the leading PC from the pentad-mean data is associated with 30–60-day intraseasonal (Madden–Julian) oscillations (MJOs). The leading PC from the monthly mean data is a hybrid of the two above-mentioned modes, capturing aspects of both. The leading PCs are used as reference time series for regressions and composites that reveal the structure of the principal modes and their manifestation in the NAMS. The leading PCs are also used to estimate the fraction of the variance of summer precipitation that is explained by ENSO and by interannual variations of MJO activity. ENSO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to meridional adjustments of the ITCZ. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of interannual variability is associated with warm (ENSO) episodes and is characterized by an expansion of the ITCZ toward the south, increased precipitation in a zonally oriented band just north of the equator, and decreased precipitation over Mexico and portions of the Caribbean. MJO-related impacts on the NAMS are linked to more regional meridional adjustments in the precipitation pattern over the eastern tropical Pacific. In its positive polarity, the leading PC of intraseasonal variability is associated with an intensification and northward adjustment of the precipitation pattern in the eastern tropical Pacific, with increased precipitation over the warm pool to the west of Mexico and over portions of Mexico and the southwestern United States. Both the interannual and intraseasonal modes have well-defined, but distinct, sea level pressure and surface wind signatures in the eastern tropical Pacific. These features extend to the middle troposphere and are capped by circulation features in the opposite sense in the upper troposphere. The relationship of the MJO to the NAMS is examined in more detail using the leading PC of intraseasonal variability and an objective procedure to identify the phase of MJO events. The leading PC is strongly related to the eastward progression of centers of enhanced (reduced) convection around the global Tropics on intraseasonal timescales. Notably, a strong relationship between the leading mode of intraseasonal variability of the NAMS, the MJO, and the points of origin of tropical cyclones in the Pacific and Atlantic basins is also present.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study presents results from a model intercomparison project, focusing on the range of responses in deep convective cloud updrafts to varying cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations among seven state-of-the-art cloud-resolving models. Simulations of scattered convective clouds near Houston, Texas, are conducted, after being initialized with both relatively low and high CCN concentrations. Deep convective updrafts are identified, and trends in the updraft intensity and frequency are assessed. The factors contributing to the vertical velocity tendencies are examined to identify the physical processes associated with the CCN-induced updraft changes. The models show several consistent trends. In general, the changes between the High-CCN and Low-CCN simulations in updraft magnitudes throughout the depth of the troposphere are within 15\% for all of the models. All models produce stronger ({\textasciitilde}+5\%–15\%) mean updrafts from {\textasciitilde}4–7 km above ground level (AGL) in the High-CCN simulations, followed by a waning response up to {\textasciitilde}8 km AGL in most of the models. Thermal buoyancy was more sensitive than condensate loading to varying CCN concentrations in most of the models and more impactful in the mean updraft responses. However, there are also differences between the models. The change in the amount of deep convective updrafts varies significantly. Furthermore, approximately half the models demonstrate neutral-to-weaker ({\textasciitilde}−5\% to 0\%) updrafts above {\textasciitilde}8 km AGL, while the other models show stronger ({\textasciitilde}+10\%) updrafts in the High-CCN simulations. The combination of the CCN-induced impacts on the buoyancy and vertical perturbation pressure gradient terms better explains these middle- and upper-tropospheric updraft trends than the buoyancy terms alone.},

	abstract = {The Arctic region is experiencing notable warming as well as more lightning. Lightning is the dominant source of upper tropospheric nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors for ozone and hydroxyl radicals. In this study, we combine the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) with Vaisala Global Lightning Dataset 360 to evaluate lightning NO2 (LNO2) production in the Arctic. By analyzing consecutive TROPOMI NO2 observations, we determine the lifetime and production efficiency of LNO2 during the summers of 2019–2021. Our results show that the LNO2 production efficiency over the ocean is ∼6 times higher than over continental regions. Additionally, we find that a higher LNO2 production efficiency is often correlated with lower lightning rates. The summertime lightning NOx emission in the Arctic (north of 70° N) is estimated to be 219 ± 116 Mg of N, which is equal to 5\% of anthropogenic NOx emissions. However, for the span of a few hours, the Arctic LNO2 density can even be comparable to anthropogenic NO2 emissions in the region. These new findings suggest that LNO2 can play an important role in the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere atmospheric chemical processes in the Arctic, particularly during the summer.},

	abstract = {Convective dust storms, or haboobs, form when strong surface winds loft loose soils in convective storm outflow boundaries. Haboobs are a public safety hazard and can cause a near instantaneous loss of visibility, inimical air quality, and contribute significantly to regional dust and radiation budgets. Nevertheless, reliable predictions of convective dust events are inhibited by a lack of understanding regarding the complex and non-linear interactions between density currents, or convective cold pools, and dust radiative effects. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is utilized to simulate the effect dust radiation interactions have on a long-lived haboob case study that spans three distinct radiative regimes: day (high shortwave), evening (low shortwave), and night [longwave (LW) only]. A sophisticated algorithm is used to track and identify the numerous convective old pool boundaries in the simulations and assemble statistics that represent the impact of dust radiative effects. To first order, dust scattering of shortwave radiation in the day leads to a colder, dustier, and faster moving convective cold pool. In the transition period of early evening, the shortwave effects diminish while LW dust absorption leads to warmer, slower density currents that loft less dust as they propagate. At night, the haboob is again warmer due to dust absorption, but gustier in the more stable nocturnal surface layer, leading to enhanced dust emissions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent geosynchronous satellites (ATS-I and ATS-III) have obtained photographs of clouds over broad regions of the earth at intervals of ∼20 min. Sequences of such photographs show the direction and speed of cloud motions. To extract the motion information in real time it is desirable to process the raw data by computer methods. One approach to this problem is to locate a limited number of centers of brightness that represent the cloud patterns in a photograph. Such centers, which am determined on the basis of area and quantified brightness, are analogous to centre of gravity in mechanics. Measurements of displacements of these centers in successive photographs provide an indication of cloud motion. Brightness centers are found by an objective computer technique called “ISODATA” that was developed in an earlier program of pattern recognition. The average distance between brightness centers is determined in part by specifying values of certain parameters in the ISODATA program. This average distance is a measure of the scale of the analysis, and can be adjusted according to the intended application. Cloud motions are derived by a separate program that matches brightness centers found on two pictures, and computes the distances between matched pairs. In cases selected for initial study, the computed cloud motions were reasonable and agreed qualitatively with motions perceived visually from time-lapse presentations of the same data. Further study is required to compare this technique with others, and to extend it to include infrared data (closely related to cloud heights) that will be obtained by future synchronous satellites.},

	abstract = {Abstract A description is given of the component parts of a computer system for automatically tracking clouds shown by sequences of pictures obtained by geostationary weather satellites. The component programs perform the following functions: separation of clouds from background; subdivision of the cloud data into groups (which are potential tracers); computation of the location, size, brightness and infrared values of each group: matching groups at two different times to give cloud motion vectors;and conversion of motions from the row and column coordinates of recorded data to earth coordinates. In this paper, the emphasis is on the automatic grouping and tracking functions. Some recent tests of the method are described and illustrated. These tests used SMS-GOES data in both visible and infrared channels for several different types of clouds, including low clouds, convective clouds and cirrus. Using 4 mi resolution data at one-half hour intervals, and with no initial information about the expected motions, the system was able to determine accurate motion vectors for clouds moving at low or moderate speeds. For high speed flow, it was found desirable to have a first guess of the motion or more frequent observations; otherwise it is necessary to use lower resolution data, thereby sacrificing some detail and accuracy in the computed motion fields. For middle and high clouds, superior results were obtained when clustering was based on infrared rather than visible data. For low clouds, the reverse was true. In terms of the accuracy and number of cloud motion vectors obtained, the overall results are considerably superior to those that we achieved previously using automatic methods. Our experience indicates that the system can process satellite data to obtain cloud motion vectors for certain research studies, or for input to numerical prediction models.},

Radar echo cells are defined by contours 3 dB below enclosed reflectivity peaks which do not enclose other cells. Attributes such as reflectivity, area, and location are tallied for each detected cell. Similar attributes are also tallied for the larger echo regions enclosed by preselected reflectivity value contours that encompass the cells. The attributes are used to extablish and maintain cell tracks within a tilt scan sequence and from one scan sequence to the next.

	abstract = {Abstract Storm identification, tracking, and forecasting make up an essential part of weather radar and severe weather surveillance operations. Existing nowcasting algorithms using radar data can be generally classified into two categories: centroid and cross-correlation tracking. Thunderstorm Identification, Tracking, and Nowcasting (TITAN) is a widely used centroid-type nowcasting algorithm based on this paradigm. The TITAN algorithm can effectively identify, track, and forecast individual convective storm cells, but TITAN tends to provide incorrect identification, tracking, and forecasting in cases where there are dense cells whose shape changes rapidly or where clusters of storm cells occur frequently. Aiming to improve the performance of TITAN in such scenarios, an enhanced TITAN (ETITAN) algorithm is presented. The ETITAN algorithm provides enhancements to the original TITAN algorithm in three aspects. First, in order to handle the false merger problem when two storm cells are adjacent, and to isolate individual storm cells from a cluster of storms, ETITAN uses a multithreshold identification method based on mathematical morphology. Second, in the tracking phase, ETITAN proposes a dynamic constraint-based combinatorial optimization method to track storms. Finally, ETITAN uses the motion vector field calculated by the cross-correlation method to forecast the position of the individual isolated storm cells. Thus, ETITAN combines aspects of the two general classes of nowcasting algorithms, that is, cross-correlation and centroid-type methods, to improve nowcasting performance. Results of experiments presented in this paper show the performance improvements of the ETITAN algorithm.},

Improvements over the original WSR-88D storm series algorithm have been made with the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking algorithm (SCIT). This paper discusses the SCIT algorithm, a centroid tracking algorithm with improved methods of identifying storms (both isolated and clustered or line storms). In an analysis of 6561 storm cells, the SCIT algorithm correctly identified 68\% of all cells with maximum reflectivities over 40 dBZ and 96\% of all cells with maximum reflectivities of 50 dBZ or greater. The WSR-88D storm series algorithm performed at 24\% and 41\%, respectively, for the same dataset. With better identification performance, the potential exists for better and more accurate tracking information. The SCIT algorithm tracked greater than 90\% of all storm cells correctly. The algorithm techniques and results of a detailed performance evaluation are presented. This algorithm was included in the WSR-88D Build 9.0 of the Radar Products Generator software during late 1996 and early 1997. It is hoped that this paper will give new users of the algorithm sufficient background information to use the algorithm with confidence.},

	abstract = {KNOWLEDGE of the kinematic structure of storms is important for understanding the internal physical processes. Radar has long provided information on the three-dimensional structure of storms from measurements of the radar reflectivity factor alone. Early users of radar gave total storm movement only, whereas later radar data were used to reveal internal motions based on information related to cloud physics such as the three-dimensional morphology of the storm volume. Such approaches have continued by using the increasingly finer scale details provided by more modern radar systems. Both Barge and Bergwall2 and Browning and Foote3 have used fine scale reflectivity structure to determine airflow in hailstorms. Doppler radar added a new dimension to our capabilities through its ability to measure directly the radial component of motion of an ensemble of hydrometeor particles. Two4 or three5 Doppler radars collecting data in conjunction, the equation of mass continuity, and an empirical radar reflectivity–terminal velocity relationship have enabled the estimation of the full three-dimensional airflow fields in parts of storms. Because of the inherent advantage of Doppler radar in motion detection, little effort has been directed toward developing objective schemes of determining internal storm motions with conventional meteorological radars. Pattern recognition schemes using correlation coefficient techniques6, Fourier analysis7, and gaussian curve fitting8 have been used with radar and satellite data, but primarily for detecting overall storm motions, echo merging and echo splitting. Here we describe an objective use of radar reflectivity factor data from a single conventional weather radar to give information related to the three-dimensional motions within a storm.},

The introduction of digital imagery to this process, which has been carried out since 1978, has made possible a partial automation of the MCC documentation procedure and subsequently expanded opportunities for research. In conjunction with these improvements, the definition of an MCC has been slightly modified from that proposed by Maddox in 1980. The warmer threshold area measurement (⩽−32°C) of Maddox's original criteria has been dropped from consideration because its measurement was too subjective, and also was determined to be unnecessary. In 1985, 59 MCCs were identified; this total is approximately 20 to 40 more than in any year since 1978, when these annual summaries began. The monthly distribution and seasonal progression of MCCs in 1985 are similar to those of prior years. The enhanced MCC activity in June 1985 is associated with a persistent favorable quasi-geostrophic forcing during that period. Significant MCC research conducted in 1985 included a prototype large-scale field program (0.-K. PRE-STORM) in May and June dedicated solely to the investigation of middle-latitude mesoscale convective systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract A robust and computationally efficient object tracking algorithm is developed by incorporating various tracking techniques. Physical properties of the objects, such as brightness temperature or reflectivity, are not considered. Therefore, the algorithm is adaptable for tracking convection-like features in simulated data and remotely sensed two-dimensional images. In this algorithm, a first guess of the motion, estimated using the Fourier phase shift, is used to predict the candidates for matching. A disparity score is computed for each target–candidate pair. The disparity also incorporates overlapping criteria in the case of large objects. Then the Hungarian method is applied to identify the best pairs by minimizing the global disparity. The high-disparity pairs are unmatched, and their target and candidate are declared expired and newly initiated objects, respectively. They are tested for merger and split on the basis of their size and overlap with the other objects. The sensitivity of track duration is shown for different disparity and size thresholds. The paper highlights the algorithm’s ability to study convective life cycles using radar and simulated data over Darwin, Australia. The algorithm skillfully tracks individual convective cells (a few pixels in size) and large convective systems. The duration of tracks and cell size are found to be lognormally distributed over Darwin. The evolution of size and precipitation types of isolated convective cells is presented in the Lagrangian perspective. This algorithm is part of a vision for a modular platform [viz., TINT is not TITAN (TINT) and Tracking and Object-Based Analysis of Clouds (tobac)] that will evolve into a sustainable choice to analyze atmospheric features.},

Comprehensive analysis routines are provided to derive properties like cloud lifetimes or statistics of cloud properties along with tools to visualise the results in a convenient way. The application of tobac is presented in two examples. We first track and analyse scattered deep convective cells based on maximum vertical velocity and the three-dimensional condensate mixing ratio field in cloud-resolving model simulations. We also investigate the performance of the tracking algorithm for different choices of time resolution of the model output. In the second application, we show how the framework can be used to effectively combine information from two different types of datasets by simultaneously tracking convective clouds in model simulations and in geostationary satellite images based on outgoing longwave radiation. The tobac framework provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of the characteristics of individual clouds in a range of important analyses like model intercomparison studies or model assessment based on observational data.},

Several examples are provided of how these kernels can be combined to produce composite algorithms for evaluating and understanding common atmospheric features and their underlying processes.

	abstract = {Automated methods for the detection and tracking of deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite imagery have a vital role in both the forecasting of severe storms and research into their behaviour. Studying the interactions and feedbacks between multiple deep convective clouds (DCC), however, poses a challenge for existing algorithms due to the necessary compromise between false detection and missed detection errors. We utilise an optical flow method to determine the motion of deep convective clouds in GOES-16 ABI imagery in order to construct a semi-Lagrangian framework for the motion of the cloud field, independently of the detection and tracking of cloud objects. The semi-Lagrangian framework allows severe storms to be simultaneously detected and tracked in both spatial and temporal dimensions. For the purpose of this framework we have developed a novel Lagrangian convolution method and a number of novel implementations of morphological image operations that account for the motion of observed objects. These novel methods allow the accurate extension of computer vision techniques to the temporal domain for moving objects such as DCCs. By combining this framework with existing methods for detecting DCCs (including detection of growing cores through cloud top cooling and detection of anvil clouds using brightness temperature), we show that the novel framework enables reductions in errors due to both false and missed detections compared to any of the individual methods, reducing the need to compromise when compared with existing frameworks. The novel framework enables the continuous tracking of anvil clouds associated with detected deep convection after convective activity has stopped, enabling the study of the entire life cycle of DCCs and their associated anvils. Furthermore, we expect this framework to be applicable to a wide range of cases including the detection and tracking of low-level clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. In addition, this framework may be used to combine observations from multiple sources, including satellite observations, weather radar and reanalysis model data.},

	abstract = {A Lagrangian view is adopted for establishing the spatiotemporal cloud statistics and the scale dependent radiative properties using satellite data. Individual clouds are identified using a newly developed scheme. We sort all clouds by cloud type, cloud area, and number of clouds in each area bin, as well as their radiative properties. For seven different cloud types our analyses provide radiative properties, such as albedo and cloud top temperature, as a function of the cloud spatial scale. All clouds are marked by local time, and large clouds are tracked over time. These analyses provide diurnal variability, lifetimes, and evolution of cloud systems as a function of their spatial scales. These scale dependent cloud properties can be objectively used in guiding the development and evaluation of cloud parameterization in global climate models (GCMs). Particularly, we show how our Lagrangian approach can be used to establish the relative importance of resolvable and fully parameterized clouds to the total cloudy area and to the total amount of reflected visible irradiance. Focus in this 1 month satellite study is on the convective-stratiform cloud systems over the western and central tropical Pacific Ocean, including the so-called warm pool. We adopt the hourly Japanese geostationary satellite (GMS) window channel radiances in the visible and IR window region for cloud classification and characterization. To study the radiative contributions of different clouds in the area, we computed the bidirectional model (BDM) for the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer instrument aboard GMS, which we show to agree well with the BDM of the Earth Radiation Budget instrument aboard the Nimbus 7 satellite. An iterative two-stage cloud detection scheme was developed to identify individual clouds. Furthermore, a tracking algorithm was developed to study the time evolution of mesoscale convective systems (MCS). It operates on area and orientationally equivalent ellipsoidal representations of these MCS. We show that the temporal statistics of these convective anvil clouds show good agreement with those reported in the literature. Our data indicate that for the convective-stratiform systems in the tropical Pacific, 95\% of the radiatively important clouds (containing a core with an effective brightness temperature {\textless}219 K) are of scales resolvable by a GCM of about 50 km × 50 km. On the other hand, a GCM of 250 km × 250 km will only be able to resolve 50\% of the radiatively important clouds. This, however, does not mean that the processes responsible for the formation and maintenance of these systems are also resolvable. The low clouds that are unattached to convective-stratiform systems are mostly unresolvable by available GCMs.},

It is used to derive statistics on cloud clusters observed during the Winter Monsoon Experiment, which was conducted in the region of the “maritime continent,” near Borneo, in December, 1978. The size distribution of the clusters identified and tracked shows that by far most of the cumulative cloud cover was accounted for by a few very large clusters. This result implies that the vertical distribution of diabatic heating in the region of the experiment was strongly influenced by dynamical and radiative processes in the widespread stratiform cloud and precipitation areas that typify very large clusters. A pronounced diurnal cycle was characterized by a preference for the very large clusters to reach the middle of their lifetime over the sea during morning. Monsoon “surge” conditions over the South China Sea also strongly favored the occurrence of large clusters over the water north of Borneo.},

Such data are often at different temporal and spatial resolutions, and consequently, there exists the need to fuse these different meteorological datasets into a single framework. This paper introduces a methodology to identify and track convective cloud objects from convective cloud infancy [as few as three Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) infrared (IR) pixels] into the mature phase (hundreds of GOES IR pixels) using only geostationary imager IR window observations for the purpose of monitoring the initial growth of convective clouds. The object tracking system described within builds upon the Warning Decision Support System-Integrated Information (WDSS-II) object tracking capabilities. The system uses an IR-window-based field as input to WDSS-II for cloud object identification and tracking and a Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies at the University of Wisconsin (UW-CIMSS)-developed postprocessing algorithm to combine WDSS-II cloud object output. The final output of the system is used to fuse multiple meteorological datasets into a single cloud object framework. The object tracking system performance analysis shows improved object tracking performance with both increased temporal resolution of the geostationary data and increased cloud object size. The system output is demonstrated as an effective means for fusing a variety of meteorological data including raw satellite observations, satellite algorithm output, radar observations, and derived output, numerical weather prediction model output, and lightning detection data for studying the initial growth of deep convective clouds and temporal trends of such data.},

The process used in this study is composed of two parts: segmentation and classification. Segmentation is performed by identifying contiguous or semicontiguous regions of deep, moist convection that are organized on a horizontal scale of at least 100 km. The second part, classification, is performed by first compiling a database of thousands of precipitation clusters and then subjectively assigning each sample one of the following labels: 1) midlatitude MCS, 2) unorganized convective cluster, 3) tropical system, 4) synoptic system, or 5) ground clutter and/or noise. The attributes of each sample, along with their assigned label, are used to train three machine-learning algorithms: random forest, gradient boosting, and “XGBoost.” Results using a testing dataset suggest that the algorithms can distinguish between MCS and non-MCS samples with a high probability of detection and low probability of false detection. Further, the trained algorithm predictions are well calibrated, allowing reliable probabilistic classification. The utility of this two-step procedure is illustrated by generating spatial frequency maps of automatically identified precipitation clusters that are stratified by using various reflectivity and probabilistic prediction thresholds. These results suggest that machine learning can add value by limiting the amount of false-positive (non-MCS) samples that are not removed by segmentation alone.},

This paper focuses on the tracking portion of this framework. Tracking is completed through a two-step process using slice (snapshots of instantaneous MCS intensity) data generated in Part I. The first step is to perform spatiotemporal matching, which associates slices through temporally adjacent radar-reflectivity images to generate swaths, or storm tracks. When multiple slices are found to be matches, a difference-minimization procedure is used to associate the most similar slice with the existing swath. Once this step is completed, a second step combines swaths that are spatiotemporally close. Tracking performance is assessed by calculating select metrics for all available swath-building perturbations to determine the optimal approach in tracking. Frequency maps and time series generated from the swaths suggest that the spatiotemporal occurrence of these swaths is reasonable as determined from previous work. Further, these events exhibit a diurnal cycle that is distinct from that of overall convection for the conterminous United States. Last, machine-learning predictions are found to limit areas of high MCS frequency to the central and eastern Great Plains.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the tracking of mesoscale convective systems (MCS) from geostationary satellite infrared data in the tropical regions. In the past, several automatic tracking algorithms have been elaborated to tackle this problem. However, these techniques suffer from limitations in describing convection at the “true” scale and in depicting coherent MCS life cycles (split and merge artifacts). To overcome these issues, a new algorithm called Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm through a 3-D segmentatioN has been developed and is presented in this paper. This method operates in a time sequence of infrared images to identify and track MCS and is based on an iterative process of 3-D segmentation of the volume of infrared images. The objective of the new tracking algorithm is to associate the convective core of an MCS to its anvil cloud in the spatiotemporal domain. The technique is applied on various case studies over West Africa, Bay of Bengal, and South America. The efficiency of the new algorithm is established from an analysis of the case studies and via a statistical analysis showing that the cold cloud shield defined by a 235-K threshold in the spatiotemporal domain is decomposed into realistic MCSs. In comparison with an overlap-based tracking algorithm, the analysis reveals that MCSs are detected earlier in life cycle and later in their dissipation stages. Moreover, MCSs identified are not anymore affected by split and merge events along their life cycles, allowing a better characterization of their morphological parameters along their life cycles.},

TAMS combines area-overlapping and projected-cloud-edge tracking techniques to maximize the probability of detecting the progression of a convective system through time, accounting for splits and mergers. The combination of projection on area overlapping is equivalent to setting the background flow in which MCSs are moving on. Sensitivity tests show that area-overlapping technique with no projection (thus, no background flow) underestimates the real propagation speed of MCSs over Africa. The MCS life cycles and propagation derived using TAMS are consistent with climatology. The rainfall assignment is also more reliable than with previous methods as it utilizes a combination of regridding through linear interpolation with high temporal and spatial resolution data. This makes possible the identification of extreme rainfall events associated with intense MCSs more effectively. TAMS will be utilized in future work to build an AEW–MCS dataset to study tropical cyclogenesis.},

The main features of this system are the following: 1) a cloud cluster detection method based on a threshold temperature (235 K), 2) a tracking technique based on MCS overlapping areas in successive images, and 3) a forecast module based on the evolution of each particular MCS in previous steps. This feature is based on the MCS’s possible displacement (considering the center of the mass position of the cloud cluster in previous time steps) and its size evolution. Statistical information about MCS evolution during the Wet Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign (WETAMC) of the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) was used to obtain area expansion mean rates for different MCSs according to their lifetime durations. This nowcasting tool was applied to evaluate the MCS displacement and size evolution over the Del Plata basin in South America up to 120 min with 30-min intervals. The Forecast and Tracking the Evolution of Cloud Clusters (ForTraCC) technique’s performance was evaluated based on the difference between the forecasted and observed images. This evaluation shows good agreement between the observed and forecast size and minimum temperature for shorter forecast lead times, but tends to underestimate MCS size (and overestimate the minimum temperature) for larger forecast lead times.},

In addition, tropopause temperature data from ECMWF operational model analyses is utilised as an adaptive detection criterion.

	abstract = {Abstract The Thunderstorm Observation by Radar (ThOR) algorithm is an objective and tunable Lagrangian approach to cataloging thunderstorms. ThOR uses observations from multiple sensors (principally multisite surveillance radar data and cloud-to-ground lightning) along with established techniques for fusing multisite radar data and identifying spatially coherent regions of radar reflectivity (clusters) that are subsequently tracked using a new tracking scheme. The main innovation of the tracking algorithm is that, by operating offline, the full data record is available, not just previous cluster positions, so all possible combinations of object sequences can be developed using all observed object positions. In contrast to Eulerian methods reliant on thunder reports, ThOR is capable of cataloging nearly every thunderstorm that occurs over regional-scale and continental United States (CONUS)-scale domains, thereby enabling analysis of internal properties and trends of thunderstorms. ThOR is verified against 166 manually analyzed cluster tracks and is also verified using descriptive statistics applied to a large ({\textasciitilde}35 000 tracks) sample. Verification also relied on a benchmark tracking algorithm that provides context for the verification statistics. ThOR tracks are shown to match the manual tracks slightly better than the benchmark tracks. Moreover, the descriptive statistics of the ThOR tracks are nearly identical to those of the manual tracks, suggesting good agreement. When the descriptive statistics were applied to the {\textasciitilde}35 000-track dataset, ThOR tracking produces longer (statistically significant), straighter, and more coherent tracks than those of the benchmark algorithm. Qualitative assessment of ThOR performance is enabled through application to a multiday thunderstorm event and comparison to the behavior of the Storm Cell Identification and Tracking (SCIT) algorithm.},

	abstract = {Abstract A fully automated, objective classification system has been developed to analyze infrared satellite imagery. This automated system facilitates tracking and categorization of convective weather systems into various classes. The classes chosen reflect the maximum degree of organization attained by each weather system. Four classes of convective weather system are defined; tropical cyclones (TS; including prestorm clusters through to decaying storms), mesoscale convective complexes (MCC), convective cloud clusters (CCC), and disorganized shortlived convection (DSL). Systems are identified, tracked, and then classified. If a system satisfies the criteria for any of the organized convection classes (TS, MCC, or CCC) for at least two time periods, the entire track is allocated to that class. In cases where a system satisfies the criteria for more than one type of organized convection (commonly MCC and CCC), it is assigned to the “most organized” class (in this case, MCC). Thus, the characteristics of each class incorporate the life cycles of systems that satisfy the imposed criteria for at least a 6-h period. Two satellite infrared-based (IR) rain-rate algorithms are applied to the convective areas in order to obtain precipitation amounts for the various classes of convection. The domain of interest extends from the eastern Pacific margin to the African coast (15°W) and 40°N–40°S. In addition to the IR data, rain rates derived from Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data are compared with the infrared retrieved rain rates at available times for a subset of each of the three organized convection classes. Rainfall amounts obtained from these infrared algorithms are also compared with ground-based station observations over Florida. Comparison of the inferred rainfall with station data reveals that the TS precipitation is in approximate agreement (in the mean), whereas the precipitation contributions from the other forms of convection are somewhat overestimated. DSL is overestimated the most and CCCs are overestimated the least. According to the infrared-based rain-rate algorithms, DSLs (short-lived systems) contribute the most total (basinwide, annual) precipitation, CCCs contribute the second largest amount, MCCs are third in the contribution of precipitation, and TSs contribute the least to the total precipitation.},

	abstract = {Abstract A simple, fully automated, and efficient method to determine the structural properties and evolution (tracking) of cloud shields of convective systems (CS) is described. The method, which is based on the maximum spatial correlation tracking technique (MASCOTTE), is a new alternative to the existent techniques available for studies that monitor the evolution of CS using satellite images. MASCOTTE provides as CS structural properties the following parameters: mean and variance of brightness temperature, horizontal area, perimeter, minimum brightness temperature, fractional convective area, center of gravity, and fragmentation. The fragmentation parameter has the potential to monitor the evolution of the CS. A new way of estimating the orientation and eccentricity of CS is proposed and is based on the empirical orthogonal function analysis of CS pixel coordinates. The method includes an accurate detection of splitting and merging of convective systems, which is a critical step in the automated satellite CS life cycle determination. Based on the magnitudes of the spatial correlation between consecutive satellite images and the changes in horizontal areas of CS, MASCOTTE provides a simple and skillful technique to track the evolution of CS life cycles. The MASCOTTE methodology is applied to infrared satellite images during seven consecutive days of the Wet-Season Atmospheric Mesoscale Campaign of the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere Experiment and ground validation experiment of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission in the Brazilian state of Rondônia in the Amazon basin. The results indicate that MASCOTTE is a valuable approach to understanding the variability of CS.},

The highly deformable nature of convective clouds, the complexity of the physical processes involved, and also the partially hidden measurements available from image data make difficult the direct use of conventional image-analysis techniques for tasks of detection, tracking, and characterization. In this paper, we face these issues using variational-data-assimilation tools. Such techniques enable us to perform the estimation of an unknown state function according to a given dynamical model and to noisy and incomplete measurements. The system state we are setting in this study for the cloud representation is composed of two nested curves corresponding to the exterior frontiers of the clouds and to the interior coldest parts (core) of the convective clouds. Since no reliable simple dynamical model exists for such phenomena at the image grid scale, the dynamics on which we are relying has been directly defined from image-based motion measurements and takes into account an uncertainty modeling of the curve dynamics along time. In addition to this assimilation technique, we show in the Appendix how each cell of the recovered cloud system can be labeled and associated to characteristic parameters (birth or death time, mean temperature, velocity, growth, etc.) of great interest for meteorologists.},

	abstract = {An automated method aimed at producing a significant European mesoscale convective system (MCS) climatology is presented. It uses Meteosat infrared window channel images and is composed of two main tools: an automated cloud-shield tracking method and a robust method of discriminating between convective and nonconvective cloud shields. The automated cloud-tracking method defines cloud systems as connected sets of pixels, named ‘cells’, after temperature and area thresholding and it is based on the overlapping between cells in successive images. It handles splits and merges of cells and takes cell movement into account. It has three parameters: the temperature and area thresholds and a minimum overlapping threshold. It is concluded that it performs a correct tracking at any temperature threshold between −30°C and −55°C and for an area threshold greater than 1000 km2, so that it allows the tracking of MCSs during most of their life cycle. The automated discrimination between convective and non-convective cloud shields uses a discrimination parameter based on brightness-temperature gradients on the edges of cells, because strong values of this gradient are observed at the beginning of the life cycle of MCSs when cold anvils develop. A seasonal study, and the sensitivity of the method to the temperature threshold, are presented. The method shows significant quality during the entire warm season (from April to September): it correctly discriminates 80\% of MCSs and more than 90\% of the most electrically active ones, while showing a low false-alarm rate around 8\%; therefore the method seems to be useful for climatological purposes.

In this study, one such approach—a beta version of the Method for Object-Based Diagnostic Evaluation (MODE) that incorporates the time dimension [known as MODE time-domain (MODE-TD)]—was applied to 30-h precipitation forecasts from four 4-km grid-spacing members of the 2010 Storm-Scale Ensemble Forecast system with different microphysics parameterizations. Including time in MODE-TD provides information on rainfall system evolution like lifetime, timing of initiation and dissipation, and translation. The simulations depicted the spatial distribution of time-domain precipitation objects across the United States quite well. However, all simulations overpredicted the number of objects, with the Thompson microphysics scheme overpredicting the most and the Morrison method the least. For the smallest smoothing radius and rainfall threshold used to define objects [8 km and 0.10 in. (1 in. = 2.54 cm), respectively], the most common object duration was 3 h in both models and observations. With an increased smoothing radius and rainfall threshold, the most common duration became shorter. The simulations depicted the diurnal cycle of object frequencies well, but overpredicted object frequencies uniformly across all forecast hours. The simulations had spurious maxima in initiating objects at the beginning of the forecast and a corresponding spurious maximum in dissipating objects slightly later. Examining average object velocities, a slow bias was found in the simulations, which was most pronounced in the Thompson member. These findings should aid users and developers of convection-allowing models and motivate future work utilizing time-domain methods for verifying high-resolution forecasts.},

The improved method has been tested using rapid-scan observations of Hurricane Eloise obtained by the GOES satellite on 22 September 1975. We performed cloud tracking using target selection (clustering) based either on visible or infrared data and tracked the targets using a pattern recognition technique. The technique matches targets with their best likeness (in terms of size, brightness and shape) at successive times in a manner analogous to human pattern recognition, and also rejects vectors in disagreement with the predominant motion in their height (infrared) category. For data of 4 and 8 km resolution, the automatic system gave results very comparable in accuracy and coverage to those obtained by NASA analysts using the Atmospheric and Oceanographic Information Processing System (AOIPS). We also tracked the same targets using a cross-correlation technique, but without internal editing. For targets that were tracked properly by both methods, the rms differences in displacements were only fractions of a pixel. To learn whether the automatic system can track the motions of water vapor patterns we applied it to METEOSAT 6.7 μm water vapor measurements. For experimentation, typical data for the midlatitudes, subtropics and tropics were chosen from a sequence of METEOSAT pictures for 25 April 1978. In flat (low contrast) water vapor fields, the automatic motion computations were not reliable, but in areas where the water vapor fields contained small-scale structure (i.e., in the vicinity of active weather phenomena) the computations were successful. The tracking results appear to be similar to those obtained by visual analysis of these same data. For the same cases (including tropical convective systems and midlatitude jet stream cirrus) we computed cloud motions using METEOSAT infrared observations and obtained excellent results. The cloud-motion vectors computed automatically appear to be competitive in accuracy and coverage with motions determined by human analysts working within reasonable time limits.},

The proposed approach first identifies a homogeneous consistent cloud mass for tracking and then establishes motion correspondence within an image sequence. In contrast to the crosscorrelation based approach as adopted in automatic CMV detection analysis, a scale space classifier is designed to detect cloud mass in the source image taken at time t and the destination image at time t+/spl delta/t. Boundaries of the extracted cloud segments are matched by computing a correspondence between high curvature points. This shape based method is capable of tracking in the cases of rotation, scaling, and shearing, while the correlation technique is limited to translational motion. The final tracking results provide motion magnitude and direction for each contour point, allowing reliable estimation of meteorological events and wind velocities aloft. With comparable computational expense, the scale space classification technique exceeds the performance of the traditional correlation-based approach in terms of reduced localization error and false matches.},

	abstract = {Monitoring the life cycle of convective rain cells requires a Lagrangian viewpoint where the observer moves with the dominant background flow. To adopt such a moving reference frame, we design, validate, and apply a simple rain cell tracking method—which we term iterative rain cell tracking (IRT)—for spatio-temporal precipitation data. IRT iteratively identifies the formation and dissipation of rain cells and determines the large-scale flow. The iteration is repeated until reaching convergence. As validated using reanalysis wind speeds, repeated iterations lead to substantially increased agreement of the background flow field and an increased number of complete tracks. Our method is thereby able to monitor the growth and intensity profiles of rain cells and is applied to a high-resolution (5 min and 1×1 km2) data set of radar-derived rainfall intensities over Germany. We then combine this data set with surface temperature observations and synoptic observations to group tracks according to convective and stratiform conditions. Convective tracks show clear life cycles in intensity, with peaks shifted off-center toward the beginning of the track, whereas stratiform tracks have comparatively featureless intensity profiles. Our results show that the convective life cycle can lead to convection-dominating precipitation extremes at short time scales, while track-mean intensities may vary much less between the two types. The observed features become more pronounced as surface temperature increases, and in the case of convection even exceeded the rates expected from the Clausius-Clapeyron relation.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study identifies the precursor signals of convective initiation within sequences of 1-km-resolution visible (VIS) and 4–8-km infrared (IR) imagery from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) instrument. Convective initiation (CI) is defined for this study as the first detection of Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) reflectivities ≥35 dBZ produced by convective clouds. Results indicate that CI may be forecasted ∼30–45 min in advance through the monitoring of key IR fields for convective clouds. This is made possible by the coincident use of three components of GOES data: 1) a cumulus cloud “mask” at 1-km resolution using VIS and IR data, 2) satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) for tracking individual cumulus clouds, and 3) IR brightness temperature (TB) and multispectral band-differencing time trends. In effect, these techniques isolate only the cumulus convection in satellite imagery, track moving cumulus convection, and evaluate various IR cloud properties in time. Convective initiation is predicted by accumulating information within a satellite pixel that is attributed to the first occurrence of a ≥35 dBZ radar echo. Through the incorporation of satellite tracking of moving cumulus clouds, this work represents a significant advance in the use of routinely available GOES data for monitoring aspects of cumulus clouds important for nowcasting CI (0–1-h forecasts). Once cumulus cloud tracking is established, eight predictor fields based on Lagrangian trends in IR data are used to characterize cloud conditions consistent with CI. Cumulus cloud pixels for which ≥7 of the 8 CI indicators are satisfied are labeled as having high CI potential, assuming an extrapolation of past trends into the future. Comparison to future WSR-88D imagery then measures the method's predictive skill. Convective initiation predictability is demonstrated using several convective events—one during IHOP\_2002—that occur over a variety of synoptic and mesoscale forcing regimes.},

	abstract = {To better understand the life cycles of convective elements in numerical model simulations, a convective updraft tracking algorithm, dubbed the Statistical and Programmable Objective Updraft Tracker (SPOUT), is developed. SPOUT identifies updraft cores in horizontal slices through a given model data set, links these cores in three dimensions to form vertically coherent updrafts, and then tracks updrafts in time via estimates of the mean local advection. SPOUT is evaluated in idealized hurricane simulations from both the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF). In both simulations, SPOUT indicates most updrafts live less than 60 min, but some can persist for over 2 h. Updrafts are typically manifested as shallow cumulus, cumulus congestus, and deep cumulonimbus. Overall, there is reasonable agreement between the vigor of convection and the amount of localized conditional convective instability. Also, the majority of updrafts attain a tilted structure that is in accordance with the localized vertical wind shear. Nonetheless, there are striking differences between models, with the higher-resolution WRF simulation producing around twice as many updrafts as RAMS. Moreover, the WRF updrafts are significantly weaker. This paper highlights the utility of SPOUT for studying convective life cycles in high-resolution numerical simulations and provides some basic features of convection in two hurricane simulations.},

	abstract = {In this study, an automatic algorithm for tracking convective cloud cells, on the basis of infrared and water vapour Meteosat images, is applied in the case of intense precipitation events of 26 and 27 January 1996 in Greece, and the results are presented. The case presented in this study has the particularity of consisting of several localized maximum precipitation events that resulted from small mesoscale convective systems. The ability of the algorithm to detect and track in Meteosat images, in real mode, propagating cloud systems of this size, through the monitoring of several cloud parameters that express cloud development and movement, is examined. It was found that the algorithm was capable of identifying small mesoscale cloud cells and tracking them consistently to the point of dissipation. Moreover, the introduction in the algorithm of new cloud parameters, which are directly related to the cloud‐top structure, has proved very valuable in providing additional information on the convective potential of the detected cloud cells. Finally, an empirical nowcasting of convective cloud movement and evolution could be carried out in many cases to support the forecaster's decisions by using information on cloud speed, direction and development in conjunction with synoptic analysis.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) occur frequently over the tropics and mid-latitudes and have a large impact on the local precipitation amounts as well as large-scale circulation through their modulation of the vertical diabatic heating profile. To fully understand and quantify these effects, MCSs must be studied throughout their lifetimes at both mid- and tropical latitudes, over both land and ocean. This can be accomplished by tracking the storm using a global scale data set of precipitation and using this information to composite collocated active sensor measurements to produce a detailed analysis of storm properties along the lifetime of the MCS. To do this, we utilize precipitation features (PFs) produced using observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission's core satellite and from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM data by grouping contiguous raining pixels in both data sets. We propose a simplified tracking algorithm to track systems throughout their lifetimes. Lightning data from the World Wide Lightning Location Network are collocated to these tracks along with GPM PFs. These are then composited relative to the time step along the track that has the greatest number of lightning flashes, which is used as a proxy for MCSs with lightning reaching the maximum convective intensity. We then examine various radar variables for tropical and mid-latitude systems of varying lifetimes over both land and ocean in order to determine the differences and similarities between these types of systems.},

	abstract = {Velocities of tracer clouds have been computed by NOAA, NASA, Stanford Research Institute, University of Wisconsin, University of Chicago, and others. Despite the fact that their methods and inherent computation speeds are different from each other, the present state-of-the-art permits the computations with 1 m s−1 speed and 4° direction in standard deviation. Such an accuracy in the cloud velocity is satisfactory for most practical purposes. The research presented in this paper warns that we have to exercise extreme caution in converting cloud velocities into winds. The motion of fair-weather cumuli obtained by tracking their shadows over Springfield, Mo., revealed that the standard deviation in the individual cloud motion is several times the tracking error. The motion of over-ocean cumuli near Barbados clearly indicated the complicated nature of cumulus velocities. Analysis of whole-sky images obtained near Tampa, Fla., failed to show significant continuity and stability of cumulus plumes, less than 0.3 mi in diameter. Cumulus turrets 0.3 to 2 mi in size appear to be the best target to infer the mean wind within the subcloud layers. Cumulus or stratocumulus cells consisting of multi-turrets do not always move with wind. The addition and deletion of turrets belonging to a specific cell appear to be the cause of the erratic motion of a tracer cell. It may be concluded that the accuracy of wind estimates is unlikely to be better than 2 m s−1 unless the physical and dynamical characteristics of cumulus motion is further investigated.},

	abstract = {This paper reviews the status of forecasting convective precipitation for time periods less than a few hours (nowcasting). Techniques for nowcasting thunderstorm location were developed in the 1960s and 1970s by extrapolating radar echoes. The accuracy of these forecasts generally decreases very rapidly during the first 30 min because of the very short lifetime of individual convective cells. Fortunately more organized features like squall lines and supercells can be successfully extrapolated for longer time periods. Physical processes that dictate the initiation and dissipation of convective storms are not necessarily observable in the past history of a particular echo development; rather, they are often controlled by boundary layer convergence features, environmental vertical wind shear, and buoyancy. Thus, successful forecasts of storm initiation depend on accurate specification of the initial thermodynamic and kinematic fields with particular attention to convergence lines. For these reasons the ability to improve on simple extrapolation techniques had stagnated until the present national observational network modernization program. The ability to observe small-scale boundary layer convergence lines is now possible with operational Doppler radars and satellite imagery. In addition, it has been demonstrated that high-resolution wind retrievals can be obtained from single Doppler radar. Two methods are presently under development for using these modern datasets to forecast thunderstorm evolution: knowledge-based expert systems and numerical forecasting models that are initialized with radar data. Both these methods are very promising and progressing rapidly. Operational tests of expert systems are presently taking place in the United Kingdom and in the United States.},

A description is given of the project, including component systems, the weather, and initial outcomes. Initial results show that the nowcasting systems tested were transferable and able to provide valuable information enhancing BOM nowcasts. The project provided for unprecedented interchange of concepts and ideas between forecasters, researchers, and end users in an operational framework where they all faced common issues relevant to real time nowcast decision making.

These systems, from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, had the capability to nowcast the location and, with one exception, the intensity of convective storms. Six of the most significant convective storm cases from the 3-month FDP were selected for evaluating the performance of these state-of-the-art nowcasting systems, which extrapolated storms using a variety of methods, including cell and area tracking, model winds, and sounding winds. Three of the systems had the ability to forecast the initiation and growth of storms. Nowcasts for 30 and 60 min were evaluated, and it was found that even for such short time periods the skill of the extrapolation-only systems was often very low. Extrapolation techniques that allowed for differential motion performed slightly better, since high-impact storms often have motions different than surrounding storms. The ability to forecast initiation, growth, and dissipation is in its infancy. However, it was demonstrated that significant improvement in forecast accuracy was obtained for several of these cases when the locations of boundary layer convergence lines (sea breeze and gust fronts) were used in the nowcasts. Based on the experiences during the FDP, and in forecast offices in the United States, a discussion is provided of the overall status of nowcasting convective storms. In addition, proposed future directions are discussed concerning the specificity of nowcast products, experimental test beds, and additional observations and research required.},

	abstract = {The effect of cloud-radiation interactions on cloud properties is examined in the context of a limited-domain cloud-resolving model. The atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) influences the areal extent of tropical high clouds in two distinct ways. The first is through direct radiative destabilization of the elevated cloud layers, mostly as a result of longwave radiation heating the cloud bottom and cooling the cloud top. The second effect is radiative stabilization, whereby cloud radiative heating of the atmospheric column stabilizes the atmosphere to deep convection. In limited area domain simulations, the stabilizing (or indirect) effect is the dominant role of the cloud radiative heating, thus reducing the cloud cover in simulations where ACRE is included compared to those where it is removed. Direct cloud radiative heating increases high cloud fraction, decreases mean cloud optical depth, and increases cloud top temperature. The indirect cloud radiative heating decreases high cloud fraction, but also decreases mean cloud optical depth and increases cloud top temperature. The combination of these effects increases the top-of-atmosphere cloud radiative effect. In mock-Walker circulation experiments, the decrease in high cloud amount owing to radiative stabilization tends to cancel out the increase in high cloud amount owing to the destabilization within the cloud layer. The changes in cloud optical depth and cloud top pressure, however, are similar to those produced in the limited area domain simulations.},

	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

	abstract = {The study of climate and climate change is hindered by a lack of information on the effect of clouds on the radiation balance of the earth, referred to as the cloud-radiative forcing. Quantitative estimates of the global distributions of cloud-radiative forcing have been obtained from the spaceborne Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) launched in 1984. For the April 1985 period, the global shortwave cloud forcing [-44.5 watts per square meter (W/m2)] due to the enhancement of planetary albedo, exceeded in magnitude the longwave cloud forcing (31.3 W/m2) resulting from the greenhouse effect of clouds. Thus, clouds had a net cooling effect on the earth. This cooling effect is large over the mid- and high-latitude oceans, with values reaching -100 W/m2. The monthly averaged longwave cloud forcing reached maximum values of 50 to 100 W/m2 over the convectively disturbed regions of the tropics. However, this heating effect is nearly canceled by a correspondingly large negative shortwave cloud forcing, which indicates the delicately balanced state of the tropics. The size of the observed net cloud forcing is about four times as large as the expected value of radiative forcing from a doubling of CO2. The shortwave and longwave components of cloud forcing are about ten times as large as those for a CO2 doubling. Hence, small changes in the cloud-radiative forcing fields can play a significant role as a climate feedback mechanism. For example, during past glaciations a migration toward the equator of the field of strong, negative cloud-radiative forcing, in response to a similar migration of cooler waters, could have significantly amplified oceanic cooling and continental glaciation.},

	abstract = {This study presents a novel approach for the early detection of developing thunderstorms. To date, methods for the detection of developing thunderstorms have usually relied on accurate Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) for the estimation of the cooling rates of convective clouds, which correspond to the updraft strengths of the cloud objects. In this study, we present a method for the estimation of the updraft strength that does not rely on AMVs. The updraft strength is derived directly from the satellite observations in the SEVIRI water vapor channels. For this purpose, the absolute value of the vector product of spatio-temporal gradients of the SEVIRI water vapor channels is calculated for each satellite pixel, referred to as Normalized Updraft Strength (NUS). The main idea of the concept is that vertical updraft leads to NUS values significantly above zero, whereas horizontal cloud movement leads to NUS values close to zero. Thus, NUS is a measure of the strength of the vertical updraft and can be applied to distinguish between advection and convection. The performance of the method has been investigated for two summer periods in 2016 and 2017 by validation with lightning data. Values of the Critical Success Index (CSI) of about 66\% for 2016 and 60\% for 2017 demonstrate the good performance of the method. The Probability of Detection (POD) values for the base case are 81.8\% for 2016 and 89.2\% for 2017, respectively. The corresponding False Alarm Ratio (FAR) values are 22.6\% (2016) and 36.4\% (2017), respectively. In summary, the method has the potential to reduce forecast lead time significantly and can be quite useful in regions without a well-maintained radar network.},

	abstract = {This study is motivated by the great importance of Cbs for aviation safety. The study investigates the role of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) filtering for the remote sensing of Cumulonimbus Clouds (Cbs) by implementation of about 30 different experiments, covering Central Europe. These experiments compile different stability filter settings as well as the use of different channels for the InfraRed (IR) brightness temperatures (BT). As stability filters, parameters from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are used. The application of the stability filters restricts the detection of Cbs to regions with a labile atmosphere. Various NWP filter settings are investigated in the experiments. The brightness temperature information results from the infrared (IR) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Image (SEVIRI) instrument on-board of the Meteosat Second Generation satellite and enables the detection of very cold and high clouds close to the tropopause. Various satellite channels and BT thresholds are applied in the different experiments. The satellite only approaches (no NWP filtering) result in the detection of Cbs with a relative high probability of detection, but unfortunately combined with a large False Alarm Rate (FAR), leading to a Critical Success Index (CSI) below 60\% for the investigated summer period in 2016. The false alarms result from other types of very cold and high clouds. It is shown that the false alarms can be significantly decreased by application of an appropriate NWP stability filter, leading to the increase of CSI to about 70\% for 2016. CSI is increased from about 70 to about 75\% by application of NWP filtering for the other investigated summer period in 2017. A brief review and reflection of the literature clarify that the function of the NWP filter can not be replaced by MSG IR spectroscopy. Thus, NWP filtering is strongly recommended to increase the quality of satellite based Cb detection. Further, it has been shown that the well established convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the convection index (KO) work well as a stability filter.},

Intense convective cells are detected, tracked and discriminated with respect to onset, rapid development, and mature phase. The detection is based on Meteosat-8 SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) data from the broad band high resolution visible, infra-red 6.2 Âµm (water vapour), and the infra-red 10.8 Âµm channels. In addition, tropopause temperature data from ECMWF operational model analyses is utilised as an adaptive detection criterion. The tracking is based on geographical overlap between current detections and first guess patterns of cells predicted from preceeding time steps. The first guess patterns as well as short range forecast extrapolations are obtained with the aid of a new image matching algorithm providing complete fields of approximate differential cloud motion. Based on these motion vector fields interpolation and extrapolation of satellite data are obtained which allow to generate synthetic intermediate data fields between two known fields as well as nowcasts of motion and development of detected areas. Examples of the application of Cb-TRAM and a comparison to precipitation radar and lightning data as independent data sources demonstrate the capabilities of the new technique.},

	abstract = {This paper outlines a radiation parameterization method for deriving broadband fluxes that is currently being implemented in a number of global and regional atmospheric models. The rationale for the use of the 2-stream method as a way of solving the radiative transfer problem for broadband solar and longwave fluxes is presented. This rationale is based on assessment of these models in the context of a novel method of classifying radiative transfer problems that more clearly identifies the types of problems encountered in calculating globally distributed broadband fluxes. The delta-Eddington model (DEM) and the constant-hemispheric 2-stream models (CHMs) are shown to be superior to other 2-stream methods of solution under this classification and also superior to 4-stream solutions for the many classes of problems relevant to modeling the global atmosphere. These two methods are used to construct a radiation model of broadband solar and IR fluxes based on the k-distribution data of Fu and Liou. When tested against available line-by-line (LBL) and other reference model calculations of broadband fluxes, it is shown that (i) comparisons of CHM top-of-atmosphere (TOA) clear-sky longwave fluxes with fluxes obtained from LBL models agree within approximately 12 W m2. The agreement with LBL clear-sky fluxes at the surface, typically within 5 W m2, is compromised by the specific form of continuum absorption parameterization adopted. (ii) The clear- and cloudy-sky solar fluxes and heating rates agree remarkably with a reference doublingadding multiple scattering model. The rms TOA flux difference under all-sky conditions is approximately 6 W m2; the layer-mean heating rate difference is 0.1 K day1. (iii) The effect of IR scattering by clouds is shown to produce a bias when neglected that generally exceeds the model-to-model differences presented. Neglect of IR scattering produces a global bias in the calculated outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) of approximately 8 W m2 (i.e., the nonscattering models calculated an OLR that is larger than what the scattering models calculated by this amount). Locally, the TOA bias may approach 20 W m2. The associated bias in surface longwave fluxes varies in magnitude between 2 and 5 W m2. It was also shown how the computational effort required to produce broadband fluxes varies linearly with the number of model layers. This is an important characteristic given the increasing tendency for increasing the vertical resolution of atmospheric models.},

	abstract = {Observations and analyses of water vapor and clouds in the Tropics over the past decade show that the boundary between regions of high and low free-tropospheric relative humidity is sharp, and that upper-level cirrus and high free-tropospheric relative humidity tend to coincide. Most current studies of atmospheric climate feedbacks have focused on such quantities as clear sky humidity, average humidity, or differences between regions of high and low humidity, but the data suggest that another possible feedback might consist of changes in the relative areas of high and low humidity and cloudiness. Motivated by the observed relation between cloudiness (above the trade wind boundary layer) and high humidity, cloud data for the eastern part of the western Pacific from the Japanese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite-5 (which provides high spatial and temporal resolution) have been analyzed, and it has been found that the area of cirrus cloud coverage normalized by a measure of the area of cumulus coverage decreases about 22\% per degree Celsius increase in the surface temperature of the cloudy region. A number of possible interpretations of this result are examined and a plausible one is found to be that cirrus detrainment from cumulus convection diminishes with increasing temperature. The implications of such an effect for climate are examined using a simple two-dimensional radiativeconvective model. The calculations show that such a change in the Tropics could lead to a negative feedback in the global climate, with a feedback factor of about 1.1, which if correct, would more than cancel all the positive feedbacks in the more sensitive current climate models. Even if regions of high humidity were not coupled to cloudiness, the feedback factor due to the clouds alone would still amount to about 0.45, which would cancel model water vapor feedback in almost all models. This new mechanism would, in effect, constitute an adaptive infrared iris that opens and closes in order to control the Outgoing Longwave Radiation in response to changes in surface temperature in a manner similar to the way in which an eye's iris opens and closes in response to changing light levels. Not surprisingly, for upper-level clouds, their infrared effect dominates their shortwave effect. Preliminary attempts to replicate observations with GCMs suggest that models lack such a negative cloud/moist areal feedback.},

Validation is conducted along the well-known skill measures probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) on the basis of Meteosat/SEVIRI pixels as well as on the basis of thunderstorm objects.

Our conclusion is that Cb-TRAM provides robust results of well-defined quality for very different climatic regimes. The POD for a thunderstorm with intense lightning is about 80\% during the day. The FAR for a Cb-TRAM detection which is not even close to intense lightning is about 50\%. If only proximity to any lightning activity is required, FAR is much lower at about 15\%. Pixel-based analysis shows that detected thunderstorm object size is not indiscriminately large, but well within physical limitations of the satellite method. Night-time POD and FAR are somewhat worse as the detection scheme does not use the high-resolution visible information during night-time hours. Nowcasting scores show useful values up to approximately 30 min in advance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The onset of vigorous cloud growth leading to storm development was characterized by cloud tops that reached subfreezing temperatures and exhibited large cooling rates at cloud top 15 min prior to the first detection of 10-dBZ radar echoes aloft and 30 min before 35 dBZ.

	abstract = {The evolution of anvil clouds detrained from deep convective systems has important implications for the tropical energy balance and is thought to be shaped by radiative heating. We use combined radar-lidar observations and a radiative transfer model to investigate the influence of radiative heating on anvil cloud altitude, thickness, and microphysical structure. We find that high clouds with an optical depth between 1 and 2 are prevalent in tropical convective regions and can persist far from any convective source. These clouds are generally located at higher altitudes than optically thicker clouds, experience strong radiative heating, and contain high concentrations of ice crystals indicative of turbulence. These findings support the hypothesis that anvil clouds are driven toward and maintained at a preferred optical thickness that corresponds to a positive cloud radiative effect. Comparison of daytime and nighttime observations suggests that anvil thinning proceeds more rapidly at night, when net radiative cooling promotes the sinking of cloud top. It is hypothesized that the properties of aged anvil clouds and their susceptibility to radiative destabilization are shaped by the time of day at which the cloud was detrained. These results underscore the importance of small-scale processes in determining the radiative effect of tropical convection.},

A one-time adjustment to shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) TOA fluxes is made to ensure that global mean net TOA flux for July 2005--June 2015 is consistent with the in situ value of 0.71 W m2. While global mean all-sky TOA flux differences between Ed4.0 and Ed2.8 are within 0.5 W m2, appreciable SW regional differences occur over marine stratocumulus and snow/sea ice regions. Marked regional differences in SW clear-sky TOA flux occur in polar regions and dust areas over ocean. Clear-sky LW TOA fluxes in EBAF Ed4.0 exceed Ed2.8 in regions of persistent high cloud cover. Owing to substantial differences in global mean clear-sky TOA fluxes, the net cloud radiative effect in EBAF Ed4.0 is 18 W m2 compared to 21 W m2 in EBAF Ed2.8. The overall uncertainty in 1Â° Ã 1Â° latitudelongitude regional monthly all-sky TOA flux is estimated to be 3 W m2 [one standard deviation (1Ï)] for the Terra-only period and 2.5 W m2 for the TerraAqua period both for SW and LW fluxes. The SW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is estimated to be 6 W m2 for the Terra-only period and 5 W m2 for the TerraAqua period. The LW clear-sky regional monthly flux uncertainty is 5 W m2 for Terra only and 4.5 W m2 for TerraAqua.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recent studies of the Earth Radiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) nonscanner radiation data indicate decadal changes in tropical cloudiness and unexpected radiative anomalies between the 1980s and 1990s. In this study, the ERBS decadal observations are compared with the predictions of the Iris hypothesis using 3.5-box model. To further understand the predictions, the tropical radiative properties observed from recent Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) radiation budget experiment [the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) parameters] are used to replace the modeled values in the Iris hypothesis. The predicted variations of the radiation fields strongly depend on the relationship (22\% K1) of tropical high cloud and sea surface temperature (SST) assumed by the Iris hypothesis. On the decadal time scale, the predicted tropical mean radiative flux anomalies are generally significantly different from those of the ERBS measurements, suggesting that the decadal ERBS nonscanner radiative energy budget measurements do not support the strong negative feedback of the Iris effect. Poor agreements between the satellite data and model predictions even when the tropical radiative properties from CERES observations (LaRC parameters) are used imply that besides the Iris-modeled tropical radiative properties, the unrealistic variations of tropical high cloud generated from the detrainment of deep convection with SST assumed by the Iris hypothesis are likely to be another major factor for causing the deviation between the predictions and observations.},

	abstract = {Abstract In the tropical African and neighboring Atlantic region there is a strong contrast in the properties of deep convection between land and ocean. Here, satellite radar observations are used to produce a composite picture of the life cycle of convection in these two regions. Estimates of the broadband thermal flux from the geostationary Meteosat-8 satellite are used to identify and track organized convective systems over their life cycle. The evolution of the system size and vertical extent are used to define five life cycle stages (warm and cold developing, mature, cold and warm dissipating), providing the basis for the composite analysis of the system evolution. The tracked systems are matched to overpasses of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission satellite, and a composite picture of the evolution of various radar and lightning characteristics is built up. The results suggest a fundamental difference in the convective life cycle between land and ocean. African storms evolve from convectively active systems with frequent lightning in their developing stages to more stratiform conditions as they dissipate. Over the Atlantic, the convective fraction remains essentially constant into the dissipating stages, and lightning occurrence peaks late in the life cycle. This behavior is consistent with differences in convective sustainability in land and ocean regions as proposed in previous studies. The area expansion rate during the developing stages of convection is used to provide an estimate of the intensity of convection. Reasonable correlations are found between this index and the convective system lifetime, size, and depth.},

These two missions have provided a 10-yr demonstration of coordinated formation flying that made it possible to develop integrated products and that offered new insights into key atmospheric processes. The progress achieved over this decade of observations, summarized in this paper, clearly demonstrate the fundamental importance of the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol for understanding the influences of the larger-scale atmospheric circulation on aerosol, the hydrological cycle, the cloud-scale physics, and the formation of the major storm systems of Earth. The research also underscored inherent ambiguities in radiance data in describing cloud properties and how these active systems have greatly enhanced passive observation. It is now clear that monitoring the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol is essential, and a climate data record is now being constructed. These pioneering efforts are to be continued with the Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission planned for launch in 2019.},

The coverage of deep-convective clouds increases with stronger upward motion, but the proportion of thick, medium, and thin anvil cloud remains nearly constant. Thus, when averaging over scales larger than individual storms, the top-of-atmosphere net radiation is only weakly sensitive to the large-scale flow. The balance in cloud radiative effects is therefore maintained across a wide range of large-scale circulations. The ability of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 5 to reproduce the observed cloud-circulation relationships is investigated. The simulated convective clouds substantially overestimate the proportion of deep and optically thick cloud and underestimate the proportion of anvil cirrus. These results demonstrate that simulating key properties of deep-convective clouds remains challenging for some state-of-the-art climate models.},

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

	abstract = {A cloud object partitioning algorithm is developed to provide a widely useful database of deep convective clouds. It takes contiguous CloudSat cloudy regions and identifies various length scales of clouds from a tropical, oceanic subset of data. The methodology identifies a level above which anvil characteristics become important by analyzing the cloud object shape. Below this level in what is termed the pedestal region, convective cores are identified based on reflectivity maxima. Identifying these regions allows for the assessment of length scales of the anvil and pedestal of deep convective clouds. Cloud objects are also appended with certain environmental quantities from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Simple geospatial and temporal assessments show that the cloud object technique agrees with standard observations of local frequency of deep convective cloudiness. Deep convective clouds over tropical oceans play important roles in Earth's climate system. The newly developed data set is used to evaluate the response of tropical, deep convective clouds to sea surface temperature (SST). Several previously proposed responses are examined: the Fixed Anvil Temperature Hypothesis, the Iris Hypothesis, and the Thermostat Hypothesis. When the data are analyzed per cloud object, increasing SST is found to be associated with increased anvil thickness, decreased anvil width, and cooler cloud top temperatures. Implications for the corresponding hypotheses are discussed. A new response suggesting that the base temperature of deep convective anvils remains approximately constant with increasing SSTs is introduced. These cloud dependencies on SST are integrated to form a more comprehensive theory for deep convective anvil responses to SST.},

This rapid decline of clear-sky longwave cooling occurs because radiative emission from water vapor becomes inefficient above 200 hPa. The emission from water vapor becomes less important than the emission from CO2 because the saturation vapor pressure is so very low at the temperatures above 200 hPa. This suggests that the temperature at the detrainment level, and consequently the emission temperature of tropical anvil clouds, will remain constant during climate change. This constraint has very important implications for the potential role of tropical convective clouds in climate feedback, since it means that the emission temperatures of tropical anvil clouds and upper tropospheric water vapor are essentially independent of the surface temperature, so long as the tropopause is colder than the temperature where emission from water vapor becomes relatively small.},

Storms are separated by surface type, size, and updraft strength, the latter defined by the presence or absence of lightning. SST data and global reanalysis products are used to explore sensitivity to changes in environmental conditions. Small storms are much more numerous than mesoscale convective systems, and account for fairly little of the total rainfall but contribute significantly to reflection of sunlight. Lightning storms rain more heavily, have greater cloud area, extend to higher altitude, and have higher albedos than storms without lightning. Lightning is favored by a steep lower-troposphere lapse rate and moist midlevel humidity. Storms occur more often at SST â¥ 28Â°C and with strong upward 500-mb mean vertical velocity. In general, storms over warmer ocean waters rain more heavily, are larger, and have higher cloud tops, but they do not have noticeably higher albedos than storms over cooler ocean waters. Mesoscale convective system properties are more sensitive to SST. Rain rates and cloud-top heights increase statistically significantly with mean upward motion. Rain rates increase with albedo and cloud-top height over ocean, but over land there are also storms with cloud-top temperatures {\textgreater}35Â°C whose rain rates decrease with increasing albedo. Both the fraction of available moisture that rains out and the fraction that detrains as ice increase with SST, the former faster than the latter. TRMM ice water paths derived from cloud-resolving models but constrained by observed microwave radiances are only weakly correlated with observed albedo. The results are inconsistent with the adaptive iris hypothesis and suggest feedbacks due primarily to increasing convective cloud cover with warming, but more weakly than predicted by the thermostat hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Longwave cloud feedback is systematically positive and nearly the same magnitude across all global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Here it is shown that this robust positive longwave cloud feedback is caused in large part by the tendency for tropical high clouds to rise in such a way as to remain at nearly the same temperature as the climate warms. Furthermore, it is shown that such a cloud response to a warming climate is consistent with well-known physics, specifically the requirement that, in equilibrium, tropospheric heating by convection can only be large in the altitude range where radiative cooling is efficient, following the fixed anvil temperature hypothesis of Hartmann and Larson (2002). Longwave cloud feedback computed assuming that high-cloud temperature follows upper tropospheric convergence-weighted temperature, which we refer to as proportionately higher anvil temperature, gives an excellent prediction of the longwave cloud feedback in the AR4 models. The ensemble-mean feedback of 0.5 W m2 K1 is much larger than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed pressure, highlighting the large contribution from rising cloud tops to the robustly positive feedback. An important result of this study is that the convergence profile computed from clear-sky energy and mass balance warms slightly as the climate warms, in proportion to the increase in stability, which results in a longwave cloud feedback that is slightly smaller than that calculated assuming clouds remain at fixed temperature.},

These are analysed for four, partly very challenging, scenes collocated with CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations in the high latitudes and over the Gulf of GuineaWest Africa.

 The results show that CC4CL provides very realistic estimates of cloud top height and cover for optically thick clouds but, where optically thin clouds overlap, returns a height between the two layers. CC4CL is a unique, coherent, multi-instrument cloud property retrieval framework applicable to passive sensor data of several EO missions. Through its flexibility, CC4CL offers the opportunity for combining a variety of historic and current EO missions into one dataset, which, compared to single sensor retrievals, is improved in terms of accuracy and temporal sampling.},

The Community Cloud retrieval for ClimateÂ (CC4CL) is a cloud property retrieval system for satellite-based multispectral imagers and is an important component of the Cloud Climate Change InitiativeÂ (Cloud\_cci) project. In this paper we discuss the optimal estimation retrieval of cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud top pressure based on the Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and CloudÂ (ORAC) algorithm. Key to this method is the forward model, which includes the clear-sky model, the liquid water and ice cloud models, the surface model including a bidirectional reflectance distribution functionÂ (BRDF), and the "fast" radiative transfer solution (which includes a multiple scattering treatment). All of these components and their assumptions and limitations will be discussed in detail. The forward model provides the accuracy appropriate for our retrieval method. The errors are comparable to the instrument noise for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. At optical thicknesses less than 10 modeling errors become more significant. The retrieval method is then presented describing optimal estimation in general, the nonlinear inversion method employed, measurement and a priori inputs, the propagation of input uncertainties and the calculation of subsidiary quantities that are derived from the retrieval results. An evaluation of the retrieval was performed using measurements simulated with noise levels appropriate for the MODIS instrument. Results show errors less than 10â¯\% for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. Results for clouds of optical thicknesses less than 10 have errors up to 20â¯\%.},

	abstract = {High-resolution (5-km, 30-min) Meteosat 7 infrared images are used to document seasonal variations of the diurnal cycle of convective activity over Cameroon and Nigeria during the period 1998-2002. Cloud fraction, considered to diagnose the properties of cold clouds, is derived by using a threshold of brightness temperatures less than 235 K, thus providing a detailed view of regional differences in the diurnal patterns. The features of the diurnal cycle of convection were investigated for six sampled regions. Over land, the diurnal cycle of convection is mainly controlled by the radiative heating and associated low-level destabilization. Strong spatial variations exist in the seasonal amplitude of diurnal cycle, highlighting that complex orography, land-sea contrast and coastline curvature play an important role in modulating the spatial and diurnal patterns of convection. There is consistent noon diurnal peak without obvious seasonal variations of the phase over the ocean. Copyright Â© 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Convection-permitting regional model output is analyzed to better understand the diurnal cycle of rainfall during the height of the West African summer monsoon. This investigation focuses on two regions, the western BodÃ©lÃ© of Chad and eastern Burkina Faso, that have a propensity for daytime rainfall, but why this occurs does not conform to our conventional understanding of being directly associated with the presence of significant topographic feature(s). The August diurnal cycle of rainfall for the BodÃ©lÃ© is characterized by an afternoon peak, with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) originating within 500Â km accounting for 80\% of the afternoon precipitation. These MCSs are associated with a deepening of the monsoon trough over the western Sahara related to northern storm track African easterly wave (AEW) disturbance activity, combined with anomalous ridging over eastern Chad associated with cold pool outflow from convection that originates over the Marra Mountains the previous afternoon. These circulation features enhance the moist low-level southwesterly flow and increase instability over the BodÃ©lÃ©. Over Burkina Faso rainfall has a primary afternoon peak, and a secondary morning peak. MCSs account for 95\% of the total rainfall. Morning rainfall is primarily due to MCSs forming over the Damergou Gap of Niger, while the afternoon rainfall is associated with MCSs that originate over the Damergou Gap as well as locally. While both types of MCSs are associated with an approaching southern storm track AEW disturbance, it is differences in northern storm track activity that helps explain why some MCSs originate over the Damergou Gap.},

	abstract = {This article presents an overview of the land ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone) over West Africa, based on analysis of NCARNCEP Reanalysis data. The picture that emerges is much different than the classic one. The most important feature is that the ITCZ is effectively independent of the system that produces most of the rainfall. Rainfall linked directly to this zone of surface convergence generally affects only the southern Sahara and the northern-most Sahel, and only in abnormally wet years in the region. A second feature is that the rainbelt normally assumed to represent the ITCZ is instead produced by a large core of ascent lying between the African Easterly Jet and the Tropical Easterly Jet. This region corresponds to the southern track of African Easterly Waves, which distribute the rainfall. This finding underscores the need to distinguish between the ITCZ and the feature better termed the tropical rainbelt. The latter is conventionally but improperly used in remote sensing studies to denote the surface ITCZ over West Africa. The new picture also suggests that the moisture available for convection is strongly coupled to the strength of the uplift, which in turn is controlled by the characteristics of the African Easterly Jet and Tropical Easterly Jet, rather than by moisture convergence. This new picture also includes a circulation feature not generally considered in most analyses of the region. This feature, a low-level westerly jet termed the African Westerly Jet, plays a significant role in interannual and multidecadal variability in the Sahel region of West Africa. Included are discussions of the how this new view relates to other aspects of West Africa meteorology, such as moisture sources, rainfall production and forecasting, desertification, climate monitoring, hurricanes and interannual variability. The West African monsoon is also related to a new paradigm for examining the interannual variability of rainfall over West Africa, one that relates changes in annual rainfall to changes in either the intensity of the rainbelt or northsouth displacements of this feature. The new view presented here is consistent with a plethora of research on the synoptic and dynamic aspects of the African Easterly Waves, the disturbances that are linked to rainfall over West Africa and spawn hurricanes over the Atlantic, and with our knowledge of the prevailing synoptic and dynamic features. This article demonstrate a new aspect of the West Africa monsoon, a bimodal state, with one mode linked to dry conditions in the Sahel and the other linked to wet conditions. The switch between modes appears to be linked to an inertial instability mechanism, with the cross-equatorial pressure gradient being a critical factor. The biomodal state has been shown for the month of August only, but this month contributes most of the interannual variability. This new picture of the monsoon and interannual variability shown here appears to be relevant not only to interannual variability, but also to the multidecadal variability evidenced in the region between the 1950s and 1980s.},

	abstract = {Abstract The common explanation for the progression of the rainy season over Africa is the seasonal excursion of the ITCZ. The ITCZ paradigm stems from a time when tropical rainfall was assumed to be associated mainly with localized convection. Its development was also linked to the emergence of midlatitude frontal concepts. The paradigm has numerous shortcomings, including the diversity of definitions and the large number of parameters used to identify the ITCZ. A historical look at the concept shows that its use over Africa has long been controversial, with many eminent tropical meteorologists harshly criticizing its applicability over this continent. However, the seasonal excursion of the ITCZ remains the classical explanation for African rainy seasons, especially in the equatorial region. This article underscores the shortcomings of the paradigm in equatorial Africa by examining various aspects of the circulation associated with the spatial and temporal patterns of rainfall during the equatorial rainy seasons. The overall conclusion is that a deeper understanding of the seasonal cycle in the equatorial regions of Africa still needs to be developed.},

It has been argued that a FAT should result from simple ingredients: Clausius-Clapeyron, longwave emission from water vapor, and tropospheric energy and mass balance. Here the first cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium designed to contain only these basic ingredients are presented. This setup does not produce a FAT: the anvil temperature varies by about 40\% of the surface temperature range. However, the tropopause temperature varies by only 4\% of the surface temperature range, which supports the existence of a Fixed Tropopause Temperature (FiTT). In full-complexity radiative-convective equilibrium simulations, the spread in anvil temperature is smaller by about a factor of 2, but the tropopause temperature remains more invariant than the anvil temperature by an order of magnitude. In other words, our simulations have a FiTT, not a FAT.},

	abstract = {We address the elusive goal of estimating optical flow both accurately and efficiently by adopting a sparse-to-dense approach. Given a set of sparse matches, we regress to dense optical flow using a learned set of full-frame basis flow fields. We learn the principal components of natural flow fields using flow computed from four Hollywood movies. Optical flow fields are then compactly approximated as a weighted sum of the basis flow fields. Our new PCA-Flow algorithm robustly estimates these weights from sparse feature matches. The method runs in under 200ms/frame on the MPI-Sintel dataset using a single CPU and is more accurate and significantly faster than popular methods such as LDOF and Classic+NL. For some applications, however, the results are too smooth. Consequently, we develop a novel sparse layered flow method in which each layer is represented by PCA-Flow. Unlike existing layered methods, estimation is fast because it uses only sparse matches. We combine information from different layers into a dense flow field using an image-aware MRF. The resulting PCA-Layers method runs in 3.2s/frame, is significantly more accurate than PCA-Flow, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in occluded regions on MPI-Sintel.},

It consists of three parts: 1) inverse search for patch correspondences; 2) dense displacement field creation through patch aggregation along multiple scales; 3) variational refinement. At the core of our Dense Inverse Search-based method (DIS) is the efficient search of correspondences inspired by the inverse compositional image alignment proposed by Baker and Matthews in 2001. DIS is competitive on standard optical flow benchmarks with large displacements. DIS runs at 300Hz up to 600Hz on a single CPU core, reaching the temporal resolution of human's biological vision system. It is order(s) of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods in the same range of accuracy, making DIS ideal for visual applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper reports on the sensitivity of the brightness temperatures associated with radiances at the surface and the top of the atmosphere, simulated for the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) 8.7-, 10.6-, and 12-ÎŒm channels under ice cloudy conditions, to the optical and microphysical properties of ice clouds. The 10.6- and 12-ÎŒm channels allow simultaneous retrieval of ice cloud optical thickness and effective particle size (Deff) less than 100 ÎŒm. It is illustrated that the particle shape and size distributions of ice crystals have noticeable effects on the brightness temperatures. Using the split window technique based on the 10.6- and 12-ÎŒm channels in conjunction with cloud properties assumed a priori, the authors show that the influence of the cloud microphysical properties can lead to differences on the order of Â±10\% and Â±25\% in retrieved effective particle sizes for small (Deff {\textless} 20 ÎŒm) and large particles (Deff {\textgreater} 40 ÎŒm), respectively. The impact of cloud model on retrieved optical thickness is on the order of Â±10\%. Different particle habits may lead to Â±25\% differences in ice water path (IWP). Theoretically, the use of an additional channel (i.e., 8.7 ÎŒm) can give a stronger constraint on cloud model and improve the retrieval of Deff and IWP. The present simulations have confirmed that cloud microphysics has a significant impact on the 8.7-ÎŒm brightness temperatures mainly because of particle shape. This impact is larger than the errors of the IIR measurements for cloud optical thicknesses (at 12 ÎŒm) ranging from 0.3 to 8. Furthermore, it is shown that the characterization of optical and microphysical properties of ice clouds from ground-based measurements is quite challenging. Especially, water vapor in the atmosphere has an important impact on ground-based cloud retrievals. Observation stations at higher altitudes or airborne measurements would minimize the atmospheric effect.},

Clouds consist of water droplets with typical diameters of âŒ20 Âµm or ice crystals with a typical size of âŒ100 Âµm suspended in the atmosphere. Cloud-radiative processes are the interactions between these cloud particles and electromagnetic radiation, including the scattering, absorption, and emission processes. Radiative transfer, which serves as a mechanism for exchanging energy within the Earthatmosphere system and between this system and the rest of the universe, is strongly modified by clouds. An understanding of cloud-radiative processes and their effects on radiative transfer is fundamentally important in climate studies and remote sensing applications.},

The brightness temperature difference between these bands is referred to as the split-window difference, and has been shown to provide information about atmospheric column water vapor. In this paper, the split-window difference is reexamined from the perspective of GOES-R and radiative transfer model simulations are used to better understand the factors controlling its value. It is shown that the simple split-window difference can provide useful information for forecasters about deepening low-level water vapor in a cloud-free environment.},

	abstract = {Abstract A new parameterization of the radiative properties of water clouds is presented. Cloud optical properties for both solar and terrestrial spectra and for cloud equivalent radii in the range 2.560 Âµm are calculated from Mie theory. It is found that cloud optical properties depend mainly on equivalent radius throughout the solar and terrestrial spectrum and are insensitive to the details of the droplet size distribution, such as shape, skewness, width, and modality (single or bimodal). This suggests that in cloud models, aimed at predicting the evolution of cloud microphysics with climate change, it is sufficient to determine the third and the second moments of the size distribution (the ratio of which determines the equivalent radius). It also implies that measurements of the cloud liquid water content and the extinction coefficient are sufficient to determine cloud optical properties experimentally (i.e., measuring the complete droplet size distribution is not required). Based on the detailed calculations, the optical properties are parameterized as a function of cloud liquid water path and equivalent cloud droplet radius by using a nonlinear least-square fitting. The parameterization is performed separately for the range of radii 2.512 Âµm, 1230 Âµm, and 3060 Âµm. Cloud heating and cooling rates are computed from this parameterization by using a comprehensive radiation model. Comparison with similar results obtained from exact Mic scattering calculations shows that this parameterization yields very accurate musts and that it is several thousand times faster. This parameterization separates the dependence of cloud optical properties on droplet size and liquid water content, and is suitable for inclusion into climate models.},

This scheme employs a linear combination of single-scattering properties from the Mie theory, ADT, and GOM, which is accurate for a wide range of size parameters. Following the approach of Q.

	abstract = {Abstract An accurate parameterization of the solar radiative properties of cirrus clouds is developed based on improved light scattering calculations. Here 28 ice crystal size distributions from in situ aircraft observations in both tropical and midlatitude regions are employed. In the single scattering calculations, the most recent measurements of the imaginary refractive indices of ice are used, thereby eliminating a large existing uncertainty. The single scattering properties of hexagonal ice crystals are calculated by using an improved geometric ray-tracing program that can produce accurate results for size parameters larger than 15. A generalized effective size, Dge is defined to account for the ice crystal size distribution in the radiative calculations. Based on physical principles, the single scattering properties have been parameterized in terms of ice water content (IWC) and Dge. This allows the cirrus cloud single scattering properties to respond independently to changes in IWC or Dge. The generalized effective size can be related to the total cross-sectional area of ice particles per unit volume, a quantity directly measured by the 2D optical probe in in situ microphysical observations of cirrus clouds. The present parameterization of the extinction coefficient and the single scattering albedo in terms of IWC and Dge can be properly applied to cirrus clouds that contain various nonspherical particles, such as plates, columns, bullet rosettes, and aggregates, etc. The present parameterization of the single scattering properties of cirrus clouds is evaluated by examining the bulk radiative properties for a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Compared with reference results, the typical relative errors due to the parameterization are âŒ1.2\%, âŒ0.3\%, and âŒ2.9\% in reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance, respectively. The accuracy of this parameterization guarantees its reliability in applications to climate models. Cloud absorption plays an important role in cloud-radiation interactions and therefore in climate systems. Because of the large variation in the co-albedo of ice near the wavelength of 1.41 ÎŒm sum, one of the spectral divisions is chosen at 1.41 ÎŒm to predict cloud absorption properly. Furthermore, the averaging technique for single scattering albedo in spectral intervals associated with absorption bands is important for the parameterization of radiative properties of ice clouds.},

	abstract = {Accurate modeling of wavelength-integrated radiative quantities, e.g. integrated over a spectral band or an instrument channel response function, requires computations for a large number of wavelengths if the radiation is affected by gas absorption which typically comprises a complex line structure. In order to increase computational speed of modeling radiation in the Earth×³s atmosphere, we parameterized wavelength-integrals as weighted means over representative wavelengths. We parameterized spectral bands of different widths (1cm1, 5cm1, and 15cm1) in the solar and thermal spectral range, as well as a number of instrument channels on the ADEOS, ALOS, EarthCARE, Envisat, ERS, Landsat, MSG, PARASOL, Proba, Sentinel, Seosat, and SPOT satellites. A root mean square relative deviation lower than 1\% from a training data set was selected as the accuracy threshold for the parameterization of each band and channel. The training data set included high spectral resolution calculations of radiances at the top of atmosphere for a set of highly variable atmospheric states including clouds and aerosols. The gas absorption was calculated from the HITRAN 2004 spectroscopic data set and state-of-the-art continuum models using the ARTS radiative transfer model. Three representative wavelengths were required on average to fulfill the accuracy threshold. We implemented the parameterized spectral bands and satellite channels in the uvspec radiative transfer model which is part of the libRadtran software package. The parameterization data files, including the representative wavelengths and weights as well as lookup tables of absorption cross sections of various gases, are provided at the libRadtran webpage. In the paper we describe the parameterization approach and its application. We validate the approach by comparing modeling results of parameterized bands and channels with results from high spectral resolution calculations for atmospheric states that were not part of the training data set. Irradiances are not only compared at the top of atmosphere but also at the surface for which this parameterization approach was not optimized. It is found that the parameterized bands and channels provide a good compromise between computation time requirements and uncertainty for typical radiative transfer problems. In particular for satellite radiometer simulations the computation time requirement and the parameterization uncertainty is low. Band-integrated irradiances at any level as well as heating and cooling rates below 20km can also be modeled with low uncertainty.},

The new approach is designed to be particularly efficient in the strongly forward-scattering case, which arises for example in problems involving cloud-ice or dust particles.

	abstract = {The aerosol radiative effects (ARE) on the deep convective clouds are investigated by using a spectral-bin cloud-resolving model coupled with a radiation scheme and an explicit land surface model. The sensitivity of cloud properties and the associated radiative forcing to aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) are examined. The ARE on cloud properties is pronounced for mid-visible SSA of 0.85. Relative to the case without ARE, the cloud fraction and optical depth decrease by about 18\% and 20\%, respectively. Ice particle number concentrations, liquid water path, ice water path, and droplet size decrease by more than 15\% when the ARE is introduced. The ARE causes a surface cooling of about 0.35 K and significantly high heating rates in the lower troposphere (about 0.6 K day−1 higher at 2 km), both of which lead to a more stable atmosphere and hence weaker convection. The weaker convection explains the less cloudiness, lower cloud optical depth, less LWP and IWP, smaller droplet size, and less precipitation resulting from the ARE. The daytime-mean direct forcing induced by black carbon is about 2.2 W m−2 at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and −17.4 W m−2 at the surface for SSA of 0.85. The semi-direct forcing is positive, about 10 and 11.2 W m−2 at the TOA and surface, respectively. Both the TOA and surface total radiative forcing values are strongly negative for the deep convective clouds, attributed mostly to aerosol indirect forcing. Aerosol direct and semi-direct effects are very sensitive to SSA when aerosol optical depth is high. Because the positive semi-direct forcing compensates the negative direct forcing at the surface, the surface temperature and heat fluxes decrease less significantly with the increase of aerosol absorption (decreasing SSA). The cloud fraction, optical depth, convective strength, and precipitation decrease with the increase of absorption, resulting from a more stable atmosphere due to enhanced surface cooling and atmospheric heating.},

	abstract = {Impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on global energy balance are investigated with a global climate model. A series of sensitivity experiments perturbing emissions of black carbon and sulfate aerosols individually is conducted with the model to explore how components of global energy budget change in response to the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the two types of aerosols. It is demonstrated how differing vertical structures of the instantaneous radiative forcing between the two aerosols induce distinctively different proportions of fast and slow climate responses through different energy redistribution into atmosphere and surface. These characteristics are quantified in the form of the whole picture of global energy budget perturbations normalized by the top-of-atmosphere instantaneous radiative forcing. The energy budget perturbation per “unit” instantaneous forcing thus quantified reveals relative magnitudes of changes to different component fluxes in restoring atmospheric and surface energy balances through fast and slow responses. The normalized picture then directly links the “initial forcing” to the eventual climate “responses,” thereby explaining how starkly different responses of the global-mean temperature and precipitation are induced by the two types of aerosols. The study underscores a critical need for better quantifications of the forcings' vertical structure and atmospheric rapid adjustment for reliable estimates of climatic impact of absorbing and scattering aerosols. In particular, cloud responses through the indirect and semidirect effects and the sensible heat decrease in response to stabilized atmosphere due to the black carbon heating are identified as key uncertain components in the global energy budget perturbation.},

	abstract = {From recent satellite observations, it is evident that an increase in cloud condensation nuclei—for instance, due to biomass burning—can substantially reduce rain efficiency of convective clouds. This is potentially important for the global climate since the release of latent heat due to condensation of water vapour and fallout of rain from cumulus convection is the most important source for available potential energy in the free troposphere. Beyond this, cumulus convection is a key process in controlling the water vapour content of the atmosphere. The sensitivity of the global climate to modification in rain efficiency of convective clouds due to the suppression of drop coalescence by anthropogenic aerosols is studied by using the atmospheric general circulation model (A-GCM), ECHAM4. This paper presents results from a 15-year sensitivity study, which considers the aerosol effect on warm precipitation formation. Effects on ice processes are not included yet, and therefore the results likely underestimate the magnitude of the full effects due to suppression of precipitation. Instantaneous forcing is large locally (up to 100\% reduction of precipitation and the related latent heat release) but confined to small areas, leading to small large-scale mean anomalies in the convective heating and therefore the vertical temperature gradient. We found a definite perturbation of the global circulation, showing distinct sensitivity to the impact of aerosols on suppressing rainfall.},

We used a series of climate model experiments to investigate the South Asian monsoon response to natural and anthropogenic forcings. We find that the observed precipitation decrease can be attributed mainly to human-influenced aerosol emissions. The drying is a robust outcome of a slowdown of the tropical meridional overturning circulation, which compensates for the aerosol-induced energy imbalance between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These results provide compelling evidence of the prominent role of aerosols in shaping regional climate change over South Asia.

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean.

	abstract = {Influence of pollution on dynamics of deep convection continues to be a controversial topic. Arguably, only carefully designed numerical simulations can clearly separate the impact of aerosols from the effects of meteorological factors that affect moist convection. This paper argues that such a separation is virtually impossible using observations because of the insufficient accuracy of atmospheric measurements and the fundamental nature of the interaction between deep convection and its environment. To support this conjecture, results from numerical simulations are presented that apply modeling methodology previously developed by the author. The simulations consider small modifications, difficult to detect in observations, of the initial sounding, surface fluxes, and large-scale forcing tendencies. All these represent variations of meteorological conditions that affect deep convective dynamics independently of aerosols. The setup follows the case of daytime convective development over land based on observations during the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere (LBA) field project in Amazonia. The simulated observable macroscopic changes of convection, such as the surface precipitation and upper-tropospheric cloudiness, are similar to or larger than those resulting from changes of cloud condensation nuclei from pristine to polluted conditions studied previously using the same modeling case. Observations from Phase III of the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) are also used to support the argument concerning the impact of the large-scale forcing. The simulations suggest that the aerosol impacts on dynamics of deep convection cannot be isolated from meteorological effects, at least for the daytime development of unorganized deep convection considered in this study.},

Previous studies highlighted the importance of meteorological covariations to the observed correlations.  In this work, we make use of multiple temporally-spaced satellite retrievals to observe the development of cloud regimes. The observation of cloud regime development allows us to account for the influences of cloud fraction (CF) and meteorological factors on the aerosol retrieval. By accounting for the aerosol index (AI)-CF relationship, we reduce the influence of meteorological correlations compared to "snapshot" studies, finding that simple correlations overestimate any aerosol effect on CF by at least a factor of two.  We find an increased occurrence of transitions into the stratocumulus regime over ocean with increases in MODIS AI, consistent with the hypothesis that aerosols increase stratocumulus persistence. We also observe an increase in transitions into the deep convective regime over land, consistent with the aerosol invigoration hypothesis. We find changes in the transitions from the shallow cumulus regime in different aerosol environments. The strength of these changes is strongly dependent on Low Troposphere Static Stability and 10 m windspeed, but less so on other meteorological factors.  Whilst we have reduced the error due to meteorological and CF effects on the aerosol retrieval, meteorological covariation with the cloud and aerosol properties is harder to remove, so these results likely represent an upper bound on the effect of aerosols on cloud development and CF.},

	abstract = {The evolution of subtropical stratocumulus clouds and the boundary layer is studied on daily time scales from the Lagrangian perspective, following the flow. Measures of humidity above the boundary layer and of inversion strength are obtained from reanalysis data, and their effects on the Lagrangian evolution of cloud cover and the boundary layer are compared. An analysis that disentangles these variables and tests their effects independently is developed. Increased inversion strength and increased humidity above the boundary layer lead to anomalously persistent cloud cover and slower Lagrangian deepening of the boundary layer. These parameters affect the stratocumulus boundary layer in different ways: inversion strength controls the buoyancy difference across the inversion, while humidity differences affect both the radiation balance and rate of cloud drop evaporation at cloud top. The relative strengths of the two effects of humidity are compared using two products: the entraining humidity in the layer directly above the inversion and the radiating humidity, which is the mean humidity in the column above the entraining humidity. Results show that the variability in the radiating humidity is the primary driver of Lagrangian boundary layer depth changes, but entraining humidity variation is mostly responsible for altering cloud lifetime.},

Increased aerosol can enhance solar reflection from clouds countering greenhouse gas warming. Recently, this indirect effect has been extended from water droplet clouds to other types including mixed-phase clouds. Aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds are important because of their fundamental role on sea ice loss and polar climate change, but very little is known about aerosol effects on these clouds. Here we provide the first analysis of the effects of aerosol emitted from ship stacks into mixed-phase clouds. Satellite observations of solar reflection in numerous ship tracks reveal that cloud albedo increases 5 times more in liquid clouds when polluted and persist 2 h longer than in mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that seeding mixed-phase clouds via shipping aerosol is unlikely to provide any significant counterbalancing solar radiative cooling effects in warming polar regions.},

In the CALIOP Level 2 product this missing low-backscatter aerosol results in the retrieved aerosol distribution significantly overrepresenting aerosol backscatter and extinction in the middle and upper troposphere if taken to be representative of the undetected aerosol. The CALIOP Level 3 product assumes no aerosol where none is detected, which then leads to an underestimation in the aerosol extinction profile in the upper troposphere. Using the ECHAM-HAM GCM, we estimate that the mean fraction of aerosol undetected by CALIOP daytime (nighttime) retrievals is 41\% (44\%) globally.},

Knowledge of the global abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground-based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN$_{\textrm{0.2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\%}}$ at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions.

While it is possible to retrieve aerosol properties above clouds under certain circumstances, aerosol properties are usually only retrieved in cloud-free scenes. Generally, the smaller spatial variability of aerosols compared to clouds reduces the importance of this sampling difference. However, as precipitation generates an increase in spatial variability of aerosols, the imperfect co-location of aerosol and cloud property retrievals may lead to changes in observed aerosol–cloud–precipitation relationships in precipitating environments. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In this work, we use a regional-scale model, satellite observations and reanalysis data to investigate how the non-coincidence of aerosol, cloud and precipitation retrievals affects correlations between them. We show that the difference in the aerosol optical depth (AOD)–precipitation relationship between general circulation models (GCMs) and satellite observations can be explained by the wet scavenging of aerosol. Using observations of the development of precipitation from cloud regimes, we show how the influence of wet scavenging can obscure possible aerosol influences on precipitation from convective clouds. This obscuring of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions by wet scavenging suggests that even if GCMs contained a perfect representation of aerosol influences on convective clouds, the difficulty of separating the "clear-sky" aerosol from the "all-sky" aerosol in GCMs may prevent them from reproducing the correlations seen in satellite data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Accurately quantifying this relationship from space is challenging due in part to contamination of aerosol statistics near clouds. Aerosol retrievals near clouds can be influenced by stray cloud particles in areas assumed to be cloud-free, particle swelling by humidification, shadows and enhanced scattering into the aerosol field from (3-D radiative transfer) clouds. To screen for this contamination we have developed a new cloud–aerosol pairing algorithm (CAPA) to link cloud observations to the nearest aerosol retrieval within the satellite image. The distance between each aerosol retrieval and nearest cloud is also computed in CAPA. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} Results from two independent satellite imagers, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), show a marked reduction in the strength of the intrinsic aerosol indirect radiative forcing when selecting aerosol pairs that are located farther away from the clouds (−0.28±0.26{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}W{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{−2}}$) compared to those including pairs that are within 15{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km of the nearest cloud (−0.49±0.18{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}W{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{−2}}$). The larger aerosol optical depths in closer proximity to cloud artificially enhance the relationship between aerosol-loading, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction. These results suggest that previous satellite-based radiative forcing estimates represented in key climate reports may be exaggerated due to the inclusion of retrieval artefacts in the aerosol located near clouds.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The polarization measurements achieved by the POLDER instrument on ADEOS-1 are used for the remote sensing of aerosols over land surfaces. The key advantage of using polarized observations is their ability to systematically correct for the ground contribution, whereas the classical approach using natural light fails. The estimation of land surface polarizing properties from POLDER has been examined in a previous paper. Here we consider how the optical thickness δ0 and Ångstrom exponent α of aerosols are derived from the polarized light backscattered by the particles. The inversion scheme is detailed, and illustrative results are presented. Maps of the retrieved optical thickness allow for detection of large aerosol features, and in the case of small aerosols, the δ0 and α retrievals are consistent with correlative ground-based measurements. However, because polarized light stems mainly from small particles, the results are biased for aerosol distributions containing coarser modes of particles. To overcome this limitation, an aerosol index defined as the product AI = δ0α is proposed. Theoretical analysis and comparison with ground-based measurements suggest that AI is approximately the same when using δ0, and α is related to the entire aerosol size distribution or derived from the polarized light originating from the small polarizing particles alone. This invariance is specially assessed by testing the continuity of AI across coastlines, given the unbiased properties of aerosol retrieval over ocean. Although reducing the information concerning the aerosols, this single parameter allows a link between the POLDER aerosol surveys over land and ocean. POLDER aerosol index global maps enable the monitoring of major aerosol sources over continental areas.},

As a major agent for clouds to form and a significant attenuator of solar radiation, aerosols affect climate in several ways. Current research suggests that aerosol effects on clouds could further extend to precipitation, both through the formation of cloud particles and by exerting persistent radiative forcing on the climate system that disturbs dynamics. However, the various mechanisms behind these effects, in particular, the ones connected to precipitation, are not yet well understood. The atmospheric and climate communities have long been working to gain a better grasp of these critical effects and hence to reduce the significant uncertainties in climate prediction resulting from such a lack of adequate knowledge. Here we review past efforts and summarize our current understanding of the effect of aerosols on convective precipitation processes from theoretical analysis of microphysics, observational evidence, and a range of numerical model simulations. In addition, the discrepancies between results simulated by models, as well as those between simulations and observations, are presented. Specifically, this paper addresses the following topics: (1) fundamental theories of aerosol effects on microphysics and precipitation processes, (2) observational evidence of the effect of aerosols on precipitation processes, (3) signatures of the aerosol impact on precipitation from large-scale analyses, (4) results from cloud-resolving model simulations, and (5) results from large-scale numerical model simulations. Finally, several future research directions for gaining a better understanding of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are suggested.},

	abstract = {Life on Earth is critically dependent upon the continuous cycling of water between oceans, continents and the atmosphere. Precipitation (including rain, snow, and hail) is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface. It is also the key physical process that links aspects of climate, weather, and the global hydrological cycle. Changes in precipitation regimes and the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, severe ice/snow storms, monsoon fluctuations and hurricanes are of great potential importance to life on the planet. One of the factors that could contribute to precipitation modification is aerosol pollution from various sources such as urban air pollution and biomass burning. Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric aerosols might have important implications for precipitation by influencing the hydrological cycle, which in turn could feed back to climate changes. From an Earth Science perspective, a key question is how changes expected in climate will translate into changes in the hydrological cycle, and what trends may be expected in the future. We require a much better understanding and hence predictive capability of the moisture and energy storages and exchanges among the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, continents and biological systems. This book is a review of our knowledge of the relationship between aerosols and precipitation reaching the Earth's surface and it includes a list of recommendations that could help to advance our knowledge in this area.},

	abstract = {Based on research showing that in the case of a strong aerosol forcing, this forcing establishes itself early in the historical record, a simple model is constructed to explore the implications of a strongly negative aerosol forcing on the early (pre-1950) part of the instrumental record. This model, which contains terms representing both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, well represents the known time history of aerosol radiative forcing as well as the effect of the natural state on the strength of aerosol forcing. Model parameters, randomly drawn to represent uncertainty in understanding, demonstrate that a forcing more negative than −1.0 W m−2 is implausible, as it implies that none of the approximately 0.3-K temperature rise between 1850 and 1950 can be attributed to Northern Hemisphere forcing. The individual terms of the model are interpreted in light of comprehensive modeling, constraints from observations, and physical understanding to provide further support for the less negative (−1.0 W m−2) lower bound. These findings suggest that aerosol radiative forcing is less negative and more certain than is commonly believed.},

	abstract = {Reflections on cloud effects
How much impact does the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols above the oceans have on global temperatures? Rosenfeld et al. analyzed how CCN affect the properties of marine stratocumulus clouds, which reflect much of the solar radiation received by Earth back to space (see the Perspective by Sato and Suzuki). The CCN abundance explained most of the variability in the radiative cooling. Thus, the magnitude of radiative forcing provided by these clouds is much more sensitive to the presence of CCN than current models indicate, which suggests the existence of other compensating warming effects.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONHuman-made emissions of particulate air pollution can offset part of the warming induced by emissions of greenhouse gases, by enhancing low-level clouds that reflect more solar radiation back to space. The aerosol particles have this effect because cloud droplets must condense on preexisting tiny particles in the same way as dew forms on cold objects; more aerosol particles from human-made emissions lead to larger numbers of smaller cloud droplets. One major pathway for low-level cloud enhancement is through the suppression of rain by reducing cloud droplet sizes. This leaves more water in the cloud for a longer time, thus increasing the cloud cover and water content and thereby reflecting more solar heat to space. This effect is strongest over the oceans, where moisture for sustaining low-level clouds over vast areas is abundant. Predicting global warming requires a quantitative understanding of how cloud cover and water content are affected by human-made aerosols.
RATIONALEQuantifying the aerosol cloud–mediated radiative effects has been a major challenge and has driven the uncertainty in climate predictions. It has been difficult to measure cloud-active aerosols from satellites and to isolate their effects on clouds from meteorological data. The development of novel methodologies to retrieve cloud droplet concentrations and vertical winds from satellites represents a breakthrough that made this quantification possible. The methodologies were applied to the world’s oceans between the equator and 40°S. Aerosol and meteorological variables explained 95\% of the variability in the cloud radiative effects.
RESULTSThe measured aerosol cloud–mediated cooling effect was much larger than the present estimates, especially via the effect of aerosols on the suppression of precipitation, which makes the clouds retain more water, persist longer, and have a larger fractional coverage. This goes against most previous observations and simulations, which reported that vertically integrated cloud water may even decrease with additional aerosols, especially in precipitating clouds. The major reason for this apparent discrepancy is because deeper clouds have more water and produce rainfall more easily, thus scavenging the aerosols more efficiently. The outcome is that clouds with fewer aerosols have more water, but it has nothing to do with aerosol effects on clouds. This fallacy is overcome when assessing the effects for clouds with a given fixed geometrical thickness.The large aerosol sensitivity of the water content and coverage of shallow marine clouds dispels another belief that the effects of added aerosols are mostly buffered by adjustment of the cloud properties, which counteracts the initial aerosol effect. For example, adding aerosols suppresses rain, so the clouds respond by deepening just enough to restore the rain amount that was suppressed. But the time scale required for the completion of this adjustment process is substantially longer than the life cycle of the cloud systems, which is mostly under 12 hours. Therefore, most of the marine shallow clouds are not buffered for the aerosol effects, which are inducing cooling to a much greater extent than previously believed.
CONCLUSIONAerosols explain three-fourths of the variability in the cooling effects of low-level marine clouds for a given geometrical thickness. Doubling the cloud droplet concentration nearly doubles the cooling. This reveals a much greater sensitivity to aerosols than previously reported, meaning too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This argument has been used to dismiss such large sensitivities. To avoid that, the aerosol effects in some of the models were tuned down. Accepting the large sensitivity revealed in this study implies that aerosols have another large positive forcing, possibly through the deep clouds, which is not accounted for in current models. This reveals additional uncertainty that must be accounted for and requires a major revision in calculating Earth’s energy budget and climate predictions. Paradoxically, this advancement in our knowledge increases the uncertainty in aerosol cloud–mediated radiative forcing. But it paves the way to eventual substantial reduction of this uncertainty. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6427/eaav0566/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Coverage and droplet concentrations (Nd) of shallow marine clouds over the northeast Pacific.Smoke particles emitted from ship smokestacks form cloud droplets and elevate Nd.

The solid cloud cover is maintained by smoke that was spread from old ship tracks, crossed by newer ones.
A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.

Here we evaluate the aerosol effect on clouds, using large statistics of daily satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean. We found a strong correlation between the presence of aerosols and the structural properties of convective clouds. These correlations suggest systematic invigoration of convective clouds by pollution, desert dust and biomass burning aerosols. On average increase in the aerosol concentration from a baseline to the average values is associated with a 0.05 ± 0.01 increase in the cloud fraction and a 40 ± 5mb decrease in the cloud top pressure.},

This study is confined to warm phase and single layer clouds without precipitation during the summertime (June, July, and August). Our analysis suggest that cloud effective radius (CER) is positively correlated with aerosol index (AI) over land (positive slopes), but negatively correlated over oceans (negative slopes) even with small ranges of liquid water path (quasi-constant). The changes in albedo at the top of atmosphere (TOA) corresponding to aerosol-induced changes in CER also lends credence to the authenticity of this opposite aerosol-cloud correlation between land and ocean. It is noted that potential artifacts, such as the retrieval biases of both cloud (partially cloudy and 3-D shaped clouds) and aerosol, can result in a serious overestimation of the slope of CER-AI. Our results show that collision-coalescence seems not to be the dominant cause for positive slope over land, but the increased CER caused by increased aerosol might further increase CER by initializing collision-coalescence, generating a positive feedback. By stratifying data according to the lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity near cloud top, it is found that the positive correlations more likely occur in case of drier cloud top and stronger turbulence in clouds, while negative correlations occur in case of moister cloud top and weaker turbulence in clouds, which implies entrainment mixing might be a possible physical interpretation for such a positive CER-AI slope.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei1. The resulting cooling tendency, termed the indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud populations are poorly understood2. Smaller cloud droplets not only reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which is expected to result in increased cloud water3,4. Such an increase in cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more water5,6,7. Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations. Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air. In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

While there is a rich history of observational work on convective clustering and organization, there have been only a few studies that have analyzed observations to look specifically for processes related to self-aggregation in models. Here we review observational work in both of these categories and motivate the need for more of this work. We acknowledge that self-aggregation may appear to be far-removed from observed convective organization in terms of time scales, initial conditions, initiation processes, and mean state extremes, but we argue that these differences vary greatly across the diverse range of model simulations in the literature and that these comparisons are already offering important insights into real tropical phenomena. Some preliminary new findings are presented, including results showing that a self-aggregation simulation with square geometry has too broad distribution of humidity and is too dry in the driest regions when compared with radiosonde records from Nauru, while an elongated channel simulation has realistic representations of atmospheric humidity and its variability. We discuss recent work increasing our understanding of how organized convection and climate change may interact, and how model discrepancies related to this question are prompting interest in observational comparisons. We also propose possible future directions for observational work related to convective aggregation, including novel satellite approaches and a ground-based observational network.},

	abstract = {It was once generally thought that stratiform precipitation was something occurring primarily, if not exclusively, in middle latitudes—in baroclinic cyclones and fronts. Early radar observations in the Tropics, however, showed large radar echoes composed of convective rain alongside stratiform precipitation, with the stratiform echoes covering great areas and accounting for a large portion of the tropical rainfall. These observations seemed paradoxical, since stratiform precipitation should not have been occurring in the Tropics, where baroclinic cyclones do not occur. Instead it was falling from convection-generated clouds, generally thought to be too violent to be compatible with the layered, gently settling behavior of stratiform precipitation. In meteorology, convection is a dynamic concept; specifically, it is the rapid, efficient, vigorous overturning of the atmosphere required to neutralize an unstable vertical distribution of moist static energy. Most clouds in the Tropics are convection-generated cumulonimbus. These cumulonimbus clouds contain an evolving pattern of newer and older precipitation. The young portions of the cumulonimbus are too violent to produce stratiform precipitation. In young, vigorous convective regions of the cumulonimbus, precipitation particles increase their mass by collection of cloud water, and the particles fall out in heavy showers, which appear on radar as vertically oriented convective “cells.” In regions of older convection, however, the vertical air motions are generally weaker, and the precipitation particles drift downward, with the particles increasing their mass by vapor diffusion. In these regions the radar echoes are stratiform, and typically these echoes occur adjacent to regions of younger convective showers. Thus, the stratiform and convective precipitation both occur within the same complex of convection-generated cumulonimbus cloud. The feedbacks of the apparent heat source and moisture sink of tropical cumulonimbus convection to the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere are distinctly separable by precipitation region. The part of the atmospheric response deriving from the areas of young, vigorous convective cells is two layered, with air converging into the active convection at low levels and diverging aloft. The older, weaker intermediary and stratiform precipitation areas induce a three-layered response, in which environmental air converges into the weak precipitation area at midlevels and diverges from it at lower and upper levels. If global precipitation data, such as that to be provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, are to be used to validate the heating patterns predicted by climate and general circulation models, algorithms must be applied to the precipitation data that will identify the two principal modes of heating, by separating the convective component of the precipitation from the remainder.},

	abstract = {The impact of giant and ultragiant cloud condensation nuclei ({\textgreater}5-μm radius) on drizzle formation in stratocumuli is investigated within a number of modeling frameworks. These include a simple box model of collection, a trajectory ensemble model (comprising an ensemble of Lagrangian parcel models), a 2D eddy-resolving model, and a 3D large-eddy simulation model. Observed concentrations of giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) over the ocean at ambient conditions indicate that 20-μm radius haze particles exist in concentrations of between 10−4 and 10−2 cm−3, depending on ambient wind speed and seastate. It is shown that these concentrations are sufficient to move a nonprecipitating stratocumulus into a precipitating state at typical cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) concentrations of 50 to 250 cm−3, with higher concentrations of GCCN being required at higher CCN concentrations. However, at lower CCN concentrations, drizzle is often active anyway and the addition of GCCN has little impact. At high CCN concentrations, drizzle development is slow and GCCN have the greatest potential for enhancing the collection process. Thus, although drizzle production decreases with increasing CCN concentration, the relative impact of GCCN increases with increasing CCN concentration. It is also shown that in the absence of GCCN, a shift in the modal radius of the CCN distribution to larger sizes suppresses drizzle because larger modal radii enable the activation of larger droplet number concentrations. Finally, calculations of the impact of GCCN on cloud optical properties are performed over a range of parameter space. Results indicate that the presence of GCCN moderates the effect of CCN on optical properties quite significantly. In the absence of GCCN, an increase in CCN from 50 to 150 cm−3 results in a threefold increase in albedo; when GCCN exist at a concentration of 10−3 cm−3, the increase in albedo is only twofold. Thus the variable presence of GCCN represents yet another uncertainty in estimating the influence of anthropogenic activity on climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cirrus outflow from deep convection are analyzed as dynamically and thermodynamically active systems. The initial outflow is considered as an analog to wake collapse, in which a neutrally buoyant flow intrusion is flattened and stretched by its stratified environment, and the initially isotropic turbulence within it is converted to other forms. The early spread of the outflow is predicted on the basis of analytic and numerical calculations by Dugan et al. Strong radiative heat flux curvature then leads to maintenance or regeneration of buoyant turbulence in the collapsed outflow plume. Mixed layer analysis allow predictions of entrainment rates. In the case of strong net radiative heating, the mixed layer model predicts an encroachment condition, in which the upper boundary attains nearly the same temperature as the environment and grows into it rapidly. This tendency is countered by bodily ascent of the warm mesoscale plumes, the rate of which is predicted with the aid of a theory of drag on a flat plate in a stratified fluid. It is found that narrow plumes rise rapidly enough that their mean temperature is not much different from the environment, and their tops may be cold enough to contribute to drying of the lower stratosphere. Wider plumes follow the mixed layer analysis and develop a substantial temperature excess and an encroaching upper boundary condition. The critical width is estimated to be of order 150 km. The effect of cirrus precipitation represents an unknown limitation to this analysis.},

Small changes in the amount of cloud coverage can produce a climate forcing equivalent in magnitude and opposite in sign to that caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and changes in cloud height can shift the effect of clouds from cooling to warming. Focusing on the Amazon, we show a smooth transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds: the microphysical and the radiative. We show how a feedback between the optical properties of aerosols and the cloud fraction can modify the aerosol forcing, changing the total radiative energy and redistributing it over the atmospheric column.
Modeling and satellite data show how absorption of light by aerosols can affect cloud properties and growth, linking these particles' opposing radiative and physical effects.

	abstract = {Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. Aerosol particles can influence DCCs by altering cloud properties, precipitation regimes, and radiation balance. Previous studies reported both invigoration and suppression of DCCs by aerosols, but few were concerned with the whole life cycle of DCC. By conducting multiple monthlong cloud-resolving simulations with spectral-bin cloud microphysics that capture the observed macrophysical and microphysical properties of summer convective clouds and precipitation in the tropics and midlatitudes, this study provides a comprehensive view of how aerosols affect cloud cover, cloud top height, and radiative forcing. We found that although the widely accepted theory of DCC invigoration due to aerosol’s thermodynamic effect (additional latent heat release from freezing of greater amount of cloud water) may work during the growing stage, it is microphysical effect influenced by aerosols that drives the dramatic increase in cloud cover, cloud top height, and cloud thickness at the mature and dissipation stages by inducing larger amounts of smaller but longer-lasting ice particles in the stratiform/anvils of DCCs, even when thermodynamic invigoration of convection is absent. The thermodynamic invigoration effect contributes up to ∼27\% of total increase in cloud cover. The overall aerosol indirect effect is an atmospheric radiative warming (3–5 W⋅m−2) and a surface cooling (−5 to −8 W⋅m−2). The modeling findings are confirmed by the analyses of ample measurements made at three sites of distinctly different environments.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the number of studies that investigate aerosol–cloud interactions has increased considerably. Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud–aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate. This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol–cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems. The authors summarize the main obstacles preventing the science from making a leap—for example, the lack of concurrent profile measurements of cloud dynamics, microphysics, and aerosols over a wide region on the observation side and the large variability of cloud microphysics parameterizations resulting in a large spread of modeling results on the modeling side. Therefore, large efforts are needed to escalate understanding. Future directions should focus on obtaining concurrent measurements of aerosol properties and cloud microphysical and dynamic properties over a range of temporal and spatial scales collected over typical climate regimes and closure studies, as well as improving understanding and parameterizations of cloud microphysics such as ice nucleation, mixed-phase properties, and hydrometeor size and fall speed.},

While both radiative fluxes contribute to convective aggregation, the net long-wave radiative flux operates at large scales (1,000–5,000 km) and stretches the size of moist and dry regions, while the net short-wave flux operates at smaller scales (500–2,000 km) and shrinks it.

We present an original high-resolution (4 km, hourly) unified data product of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and isolated deep convection (IDC) in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and examine their climatological characteristics from 2004 to 2017. The data product is produced by applying an updated Flexible Object Tracker algorithm to hourly satellite brightness temperature, radar reflectivity, and precipitation datasets. Analysis of the data product shows that MCSs are much larger and longer-lasting than IDC, but IDC occurs about 100 times more frequently than MCSs, with a mean convective intensity comparable to that of MCSs. Hence both MCS and IDC are essential contributors to precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains, although their precipitation shows significantly different spatiotemporal characteristics. IDC precipitation concentrates in summer in the Southeast with a peak in the late afternoon, while MCS precipitation is significant in all seasons, especially for spring and summer in the Great Plains. The spatial distribution of MCS precipitation amounts varies by season, while diurnally, MCS precipitation generally peaks during nighttime except in the Southeast. Potential uncertainties and limitations of the data product are also discussed. The data product is useful for investigating the atmospheric environments and physical processes associated with different types of convective systems; quantifying the impacts of convection on hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, and severe weather events; and evaluating and improving the representation of convective processes in weather and climate models.

	abstract = {Sea breeze fronts propagate inland from the coastline, driving convective initiation and aerosol redistribution. Forecasting sea breezes is challenging due to uncertainties in the initial conditions, as well as the covariance and interaction of various meteorological and surface parameters. Using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System coupled to an interactive land-surface model, we conduct an ensemble of 130 idealized cloud-resolving simulations by simultaneously perturbing six atmospheric and four surface parameters describing the initial conditions. To identify the key parameters impacting the inland characteristics and the intensity of the sea breeze convection in a tropical rainforest, we apply statistical emulation and variance-based sensitivity analysis techniques. This study extends a previous study which explored the impacts of various parameters on sea breeze characteristics in arid environments devoid of moist convection. Wind speed is identified as the main contributor to the inland extent, similar to the arid environment study. However, the relative impacts of surface properties on the inland extent are less significant in the moist environment where land-surface heating can be suppressed via moist convective processes and vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Two sea breeze-initiated convection regimes are also identified: shallow and deep. Over the shallow regime, where convective available potential energy is limited, the inversion layer strength is the primary control of the convective intensity. Over the deep regime, boundary layer temperature exerts a robust control over the convective available potential energy and hence the convective intensity. The potential vertical redistribution of aerosols is closely related to the convective intensity.},

Two aircraft cases with simultaneous Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (MIR), Multispectral Atmospheric Mapping Sensor (MAMS), and ER-2 Doppler radar (EDOP) measurements during the Convection And Moisture EXperiment (CAMEX)-3 in August 1998 are analyzed to investigate the inﬂuence of high thick cirrus clouds on two previously developed IR methods. In contrast, a microwave method based on the brightness temperature differences between the three water vapor channels around 183.3 GHz of the Advanced Microwave Sounder Unit (AMSU)-B (183.3 ± 1, 183.3 ± 3, and 183.3 ± 7 GHz) can screen out high thick cirrus clouds efﬁciently. The tropical deep convective cloud fractions (30◦ S–30◦ N) estimated by the IR methods and the AMSU-B method are compared. Although their geographical distributions are in well agreement with each other, the total fractions detected by the IR methods are about 2 to 3.5 times greater than that detected by the AMSU-B method. Moreover, the overestimation of deep convective cloud fractions by the IR method (11 µm brightness temperature less than 215 K) can result in a displacement in the detected location of the deep convective clouds. The average thick cirrus clouds cover 2.5 times the area of the deep convective clouds that generates them.},

Studying the interactions and feedbacks between multiple deep convective clouds, however, poses a challenge for existing algorithms due to the necessary compromise between false detection and missed detection errors. We utilise an optical flow method to determine the motion of deep convective clouds in GOES-16 ABI imagery in order to construct a semi-Lagrangian framework for the motion of the cloud field, independently of the detection and tracking of cloud objects. The semi-Lagrangian framework allows for severe storms to be simultaneously detected and tracked in both spatial and temporal dimensions. For the purpose of this framework we have developed a novel Lagrangian convolution method and a number of novel implementations of morphological image operations that account for the motion of observed objects. These novel methods allow the accurate extension of computer vision techniques to the temporal domain for moving objects such as DCCs. By combining this framework with existing methods for detecting deep convective clouds (including detection of growing cores through cloud top cooling and detection of anvil using brightness temperature), we show that the novel framework enables reductions in errors due to both false and missed detections compared to any of the individual methods, reducing the need to compromise when compared with existing frameworks. The novel framework enables the continuous tracking of anvil clouds associated with detected deep convection after convective activity has stopped, enabling the study of the entire lifecycle of deep convective clouds and their associated anvils. Furthermore, we expect this framework to applicable to a wide range of cases including the detection and tracking of low-level clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. In addition, this framework may be used to combine observations from multiple sources, including satellite observations, weather radar and reanalysis model data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Precipitation estimates from satellite infrared (IR) radiometers are typically based on cloud top temperatures. However, these temperatures are weakly related to surface rainfall, particularly for shallow or warm clouds. This study classifies precipitating clouds into five cloud groups. The classification uses three brightness temperature differences (BTDs) and one BTD difference (ΔBTD) from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI): BTD1 (6.2–11.2 µm), BTD2 (8.6–11.2 µm), BTD3 (11.2–12.4 µm), and ΔBTD (BTD2 − BTD3). BTD1 is found to be effective for separating shallow and non-shallow clouds in reference to the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) level 2 data. Once this separation is complete, non-shallow clouds are further classified. The negative and positive values of ΔBTD usually indicate more water and more ice in clouds, respectively, distinguishing non-shallow clouds with tall and taller cloud heights. Subsequently, BTD1 is applied to non-shallow-tall/taller clouds. Because these clouds can be considered as optically thick, BTD1 identifies the relative coldness of the cloud top based on the extent of water vapour over the cloud top. The final classification yields four non-shallow cloud types: non-shallow-tall-cold, non-shallow-tall-colder, non-shallow-taller-cold, and non-shallow-taller-colder clouds. The relationships between IR brightness temperatures and surface rainfall obtained from the classified cloud groups over four latitude bands reveal clear differences, implying that separating cloud types and accounting for regional differences are desirable to improve the accuracy of IR-based precipitation measurements.},

It excels at clustering simple flashes but experiences anomalies with complex flashes that last longer than 3 s or contain more than 100 groups, leading to flashes being artificially split. We develop a technique that corrects these anomalies and apply it to the 2018 GLM data to document all lightning across the Americas. We produce statistics describing the characteristics and frequencies of reclustered GLM flashes and thunderstorm area features. The average GLM Americas flash rate in 2018 was 11.7 flashes per second with the greatest flash rate densities occurring over Lake Maracaibo (157 flashes per km2/year). Lloró, Chocó, Colombia had the most thunderstorm activity with 256 thunder days. The longest GLM flash spanned 673 km, the largest flash covered 114,997 km2, and the longest-lasting flash had a 13.496-s duration. The first case occurred over Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, while the other two cases occurred in the central United States. All three extreme flashes are located in the stratiform regions of Mesoscale Convective Systems. The highest flash rate for a thunderstorm area feature was 17.6 flashes per second, while the largest thunderstorm was 216,865 km2 in size. Both storms occurred in South America. These initial results demonstrate the value that the development of a reprocessed GLM science product would offer and how such a product might be created at a reduced computational cost., NOAA’s newest geostationary weather satellites (GOES-16 and GOES-17) are the first to feature lightning detectors. These sensors are known as Geostationary Lightning Mappers (GLMs) and use the flash of light illuminating the cloud during a lightning discharge to detect it and determine where it occurred. GLM uses specialized algorithms to identify individual lightning flashes. These algorithms only have 5 s to find all of the flashes that occurred across North and South America and can easily get bogged down by the tremendous amount of GLM data coming down from the satellite. To overcome this, the algorithms quit when flashes become too complex, and this results in single natural lightning flashes being artificially split into multiple degraded flashes. We develop a technique for fixing this splitting problem and apply it to all of the 2018 GLM data. This new data set allows us to examine all types of lightning, not just simple flashes. We use this corrected data to show how often lightning and thunderstorms occur, to document what flashes look like, and to identify extreme examples of lightning across the Americas.},

	abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) is the next block of four satellites to follow the existing GOES constellation currently operating over the Western Hemisphere. Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8km with a product refresh rate of less than 20s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings.},

	abstract = {The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) is a space-based instrument specifically designed to detect and locate lightning discharges as it orbits the Earth. This instrument is a scientific payload on the MicroLab-1 satellite that was launched into a 70° inclination low Earth orbit in April 1995. Given the orbital trajectory of the satellite, most regions of the Earth are observed by the OTD instrument more than 400 times during a 1 year period, and the average duration of each observation is 2 min. The OTD instrument optically detects lightning flashes that occur within its 1300 × 1300 km2 field of view during both day and night conditions. A statistical examination of OTD lightning data reveals that nearly 1.4 billion flashes occur annually over the entire Earth. This annual flash count translates to an average of 44 ± 5 lightning flashes (intracloud and cloud-to-ground combined) occurring around the globe every second, which is well below the traditional estimate of 100 fl s−1 that was derived in 1925 from world thunder day records. The range of uncertainty for the OTD global totals represents primarily the uncertainty (and variability) in the flash detection efficiency of the instrument. The OTD measurements have been used to construct lightning climatology maps that demonstrate the geographical and seasonal distribution of lightning activity for the globe. An analysis of this annual lightning distribution confirms that lightning occurs mainly over land areas, with an average land/ocean ratio of ∼10:1. The Congo basin, which stands out year-round, shows a peak mean annual flash density of 80 fl km−2 yr−1 in Rwanda, and includes an area of over 3 million km2 exhibiting flash densities greater than 30 fl km−2 yr−1 (the flash density of central Florida). Lightning is predominant in the northern Atlantic and western Pacific Ocean basins year-round where instability is produced from cold air passing over warm ocean water. Lightning is less frequent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean basins where the air mass is warmer. A dominant Northern Hemisphere summer peak occurs in the annual cycle, and evidence is found for a tropically driven semiannual cycle.},

Two detectors, one operating in the 375–695 nm region and one in the 650–880 nm region, recorded emissions from the same lightning. Ten flashes containing 46 recorded strokes were selected for detailed analysis from 500 flashes recorded in 1981. Thew ten flashes occurred within three degrees of the optical axis of the spectrometer system. The average stroke spectral irradiance from 375 to 650 nm for flashes at approximately 15 km is 3.5 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke with a standard deviation of 2.0 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ and a range from 0.7 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ to 6.8 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke. The average stroke spectral irradiance from 650 to 880 nm for the same strokes is 1.2 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ j m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke with a standard deviation of 0.7 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ and a range from 0.5 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ to 3.2 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke. The ratio of the visible to infrared spectral irradiance for the previously specified wavelength ranges, 375–650 and 650–880 nm, is 3.

A summary table of spectral irradiance values in 50 nm increments is presented. The strongest emissions in 50 nm increments occur in the visible region centered at 505 nm. These emissions are over four times greater than at a similar 50 nm increment centered at 825 nm.

Because the split-window method provides cloud properties that are consistent for day and night, it is ideally suited for the generation of a cloud climatology from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which provides sampling roughly four times per day. While the split-window approach is applicable to all clouds, this paper focuses on its application to cirrus (high semitransparent ice clouds), where this approach is most powerful. An optimal estimation framework is used to extract estimates of cloud temperature, cloud emissivity, and cloud microphysics from the AVHRR split-window observations. The performance of the split-window approach is illustrated through the diagnostic quantities generated by the optimal estimation approach. An objective assessment of the performance of the algorithm cloud products from the recently launched space lidar [Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO/CALIOP)] is used to characterize the performance of the AVHRR results and also to provide the constraints needed for the optimal estimation approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

These filters differ in their complexity and intended use. We use the most appropriate filters to document the severity of GLM solar contamination and to compute the frequency of extreme Americas lightning. Solar artifacts occur at an average rate of one every {\textasciitilde}8 min. Due to their continuous emissions across a portion of the GLM CCD array, these events disproportionately contribute to the GLM event and group rates. Up to 40\% of all events recorded between 10:00 and 12:00 local time during 2018 were solar artifacts. The frequency-domain solar filter also reveals a carrier wave at 50 to 60 Hz in some lightning flashes and solar episodes that appears to be anthropogenic in origin. Removing the relatively frequent solar artifact cases reveals rare cases of extreme lightning flashes. Exceptional flashes on the order of 500+ km in length and 10+ s in duration only occur a few times per year and are produced by storms that are predisposed for exceptional lightning rather than as single random occurrences.},

	abstract = {Global atmospheric heat exchanges are highly dependent on the variation of cloud types and amounts. For a better understanding of these exchanges, an appropriate cloud type classification method is necessary. The present study proposes an alternative approach to the often used cloud optical and thermodynamic properties based classifications. This approach relies on the application of edge detection techniques on cloud top temperature (CTT) derived from global satellite maps. The gradient map obtained through these techniques is then used to distinguish various types of clouds. The edge detection techniques used are based on the idea that a pixel’s neighborhood contains information about its intensity. The variation of this intensity (gradient) offers the possibility to decompose the image into different cloud morphological features. High gradient areas would correspond to cumulus-like clouds, while low gradient areas would be associated with stratus-like clouds. Following the application of these principles, the results of the cloud classification obtained are evaluated against a common cloud classification method based on cloud optical properties’ variations. Relatively good matches between the two approaches are obtained. The best results are observed with high gradient clouds and the worst with low gradient clouds.},

This study is motivated by National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster reviews of the algorithm output, which hypothesized that more intense cloud-top cooling corresponds to more vigorous short-term (0–60 min) convective development. An objective validation of UW-CTC rates using a satellite-based object-tracking methodology is presented, along with a prognostic evaluation of such cloud-top cooling rates for use in forecasting the growth and development of deep convection. In general, both a cloud object’s instantaneous and maximum cooling rate(s) are shown to be useful prognostic tools in predicting future radar intensification. UW-CTC rates are shown to be most skillful in detecting convective clouds that achieved intense radar signatures. The UW-CTC rate lead time ahead of the various radar fields is also shown, along with an illustration of the benefit of UW-CTC rates in operational forecasting. The results of this study suggest that convective clouds with the strongest UW-CTC rates are more likely to achieve significant near-term (0–60 min) radar signatures in such fields as composite reflectivity, vertically integrated liquid (VIL), and maximum estimated size of hail (MESH) compared to clouds that exhibit only weak UW-CTC rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

The novel "cluster multiple labeling technique" is described for both two- and three-dimensional crystal structures. Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the same cluster. These sites are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful for the determination of the critical percolation concentration of a finite lattice is also presented. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in conjunction with the cluster multiple labeling technique. The basic features of this technique are illustrated by applying it to a small planar square lattice. Numerical results are given for a triangular subcrystal containing up to 9 000 000 sites. These results compare favorably with the exact value of the infinite lattice critical percolation concentration.},

The network does not rely on a parse tree and is easily applicable to any language. We test the DCNN in four experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision.

Many attributes of the ABI—such as spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution; radiometrics; and image navigation/registration—are much improved from the current series of GOES imagers. This paper highlights and discusses the expected improvements of each of these attributes. From ABI data many higher-level-derived products can be generated and used in a large number of environmental applications. The ABI’s design allows rapid-scan and contiguous U.S. imaging automatically interleaved with full-disk scanning. In this paper the expected instrument attributes are covered, as they relate to signal-to-noise ratio, image navigation and registration, the various ABI scan modes, and other parameters. There will be several methods for users to acquire GOES-R imagery and products depending on their needs. These include direct reception of the imagery via the satellite downlink and an online-accessible archive. The information from the ABI on the GOES-R series will be used for many applications related to severe weather, tropical cyclones and hurricanes, aviation, natural hazards, the atmosphere, the ocean, and the cryosphere.The ABI on the GOES-R series is America’s next-generation geostationary advanced imager and will dramatically improve the monitoring of many phenomena at finer time and space scales.},

It is observed that Johnson SB function is the best continuous distribution function in explaining the histogram of infrared brightness temperatures of the convective clouds. The best fit is confirmed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Johnson SB’s distribution of histogram of infrared brightness temperatures clearly discriminates the cloud pixels of deep convective and non-deep convective cases. It also captures the asymmetric nature in histogram of infrared brightness temperatures. We also observed that Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures for deep convective systems is different in each of the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. And Johnson SB parameters are observed to be best in discriminating the Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures of deep convective systems for each season. Due to these properties of Johnson SB function, it can be utilized in the modelling of the histogram of infrared brightness temperature of deep convective and non-deep convective systems.

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important to the water and energy budget of the tropical climate and are essential ingredients of the tropical circulation. MCSs are readily observed in satellite infrared geostationary imagery as cloud clusters that evolve in time from small structures to well-organized large patches of cloud shield before dissipating. The MCS cloud shield is the result of a large ensemble of mesoscale dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical processes. This study shows that a simple parametric model can summarize the time evolution of the morphological characteristics of the cloud shield during the life cycle of the MCS. It consists of a growth–decay linear model of the cloud shield and is based on three parameters: the time of maximum extent, the maximum extent, and the duration of the MCS. It is shown that the time of maximum is frequently close to the middle of the life cycle and that the correlation between maximum extent and duration is strong all over the tropics. This suggests that 1 degree of freedom is left to summarize the life cycle of the MCS cloud shield. Such a model fits the observed MCS equally well, independent of the duration, size, location, and propagation characteristics, and its relevance is assessed for a large number of MCSs over three boreal summer periods over the whole tropical belt. The scaling of this simple model exhibits weak (strong) regional variability for the short- (long-) lived systems indicative of the primary importance of the internal dynamics of the systems to the large-scale environment for MCS sustainability.},

This paper presents a new objective infrared-only satellite OT detection method called infrared window (IRW)-texture. This method uses a combination of 1) infrared window channel brightness temperature (BT) gradients, 2) an NWP tropopause temperature forecast, and 3) OT size and BT criteria defined through analysis of 450 thunderstorm events within 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Qualitative validation of the IRW-texture and the well-documented water vapor (WV) minus IRW BT difference (BTD) technique is performed using visible channel imagery, CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar, and/or Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) cloud-top height for selected cases. Quantitative validation of these two techniques is obtained though comparison with OT detections from synthetic satellite imagery derived from a cloud-resolving NWP simulation. The results show that the IRW-texture method false-alarm rate ranges from 4.2\% to 38.8\%, depending upon the magnitude of the overshooting and algorithm quality control settings. The results also show that this method offers a significant improvement over the WV-IRW BTD technique. A 5-yr {\textless}em{\textgreater}Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-12{\textless}/em{\textgreater} OT climatology shows that OTs occur frequently over the Gulf Stream and Great Plains during the nighttime hours, which underscores the importance of using a day/night infrared-only detection algorithm. {\textless}em{\textgreater}GOES-12{\textless}/em{\textgreater} OT detections are compared with objective Eddy Dissipation Rate Turbulence and National Lightning Detection Network observations to show the strong relationship among OTs, aviation turbulence, and cloud-to-ground lightning activity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Simultaneous observations of deep convective clouds in the infrared window (IR: 10.5 – 12.5 μm) and the water vapour absorption band (WV: 5.7 – 7.1 μm) from METEOSAT reveal that the equivalent brightness temperature in the WV channel can be larger than in the IR channel by as much as 6 – 8 K. Calibration errors, cloud microphysics and the effect of the Planck function over horizontally inhomogeneous areas cannot explain the observation. Simulations with a line-by-line radiative transfer model show that the larger brightness temperatures in the WV absorption band are due to stratospheric water vapour, which absorbs radiation from the cold cloud top and emits radiation at higher stratospheric temperatures. The brightness temperature difference depends on the amount of water vapour and on the temperature lapse rate in the stratosphere. The temperature difference is largest when the cloud top is at the tropopause temperature inversion. The tropopause temperature in regions of deep convective clouds can be estimated from the brightness temperature differences observed in consecutive images from geostationary satellites. The method also has the potential for monitoring areas of troposphere-stratosphere exchange.},

Thresholds for the brightness temperature differences between the three channels are suggested as criterion to detect deep convective clouds, and an order relation between the differences is used to detect convective overshooting. The procedure is based on an investigation of the influence of deep convective cloud systems on the microwave brightness temperatures at frequencies from 89 to 220 GHz using simultaneous aircraft microwave and radar measurements over two tropical deep convective cloud systems, taken during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) campaign. Two other aircraft cases with deep convective cloud systems observed during the Third Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX-3) are used to validate the criteria. Furthermore, a microwave radiative transfer model and simulated mature tropical squall line data derived from the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model are used to validate the procedures and to adapt the criteria to the varying viewing angle of AMSU-B. These methods are employed to investigate the distributions of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics (30°S to 30°N) for the four 3-month seasons from March 2003 to February 2004 using the AMSU-B data from NOAA-15, -16, and -17. The distributions show a seasonal variability of shifting from the winter hemisphere to the summer hemisphere. The distributions of deep convective clouds follow the seasonal patterns of the surface rainfall rates. The deep convective clouds over land penetrate more frequently into the tropical tropopause layer than those over ocean. The averaged deep convective cloud fraction is about 0.3\% in the tropics, and convective overshooting contributes about 26\% to this.},

	abstract = {We analyze the spatial distribution of deep convection and its diurnal cycle and life cycle over Africa in June and December 2006. We investigate regions of distinct temporal evolution and of largest frequency of occurrence of deep convection (hereinafter referred to as convective activity), and we define and identify the deep convective stage from space observations. The analysis is based on hourly, half-hourly, and quarter-hourly brightness temperature (BT) observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat 8. Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are utilized. In the Eulerian approach, diurnal cycles and spatial distributions of BTs are calculated as averages on a local solar time (LST) and pixel basis. In the Lagrangian approach we use a stand-alone algorithm that tracks deep convective systems. Deep convection is frequently found over mountainous regions and exhibits a distinct diurnal cycle over large lakes. Local maxima of convective activity and origin of tracked systems are observed over the ocean off the west coast of Africa early in the morning. Over land the diurnal cycle of deep convective systems starts with strong rates of BT change in the formative stage, continues with the minimum BT around 1530 LST (start of the mature stage), and reaches the maximum cold cloud cover at 1730 LST (end of mature stage). The maximum number of split events marks the center of the dissipation stage at ∼1930 LST. A time shift of 1–2 h to earlier times is found in December. The life cycle analysis perfectly complements the diurnal cycle analysis and reveals characteristics of deep convective systems around the time of minimum BT10.8. Extreme rates of BT change and area expansion rates successively increase with decreasing temporal resolution. Thus quarter-hourly measurements are needed to observe the most vigorous updraft and downdraft events.},

	abstract = {Deep moist convection is an inherently multiscale phenomenon with organization processes coupling convective elements to larger-scale structures. A realistic representation of the tropical dynamics demands a simulation framework that is capable of representing physical processes across a wide range of scales. Therefore, storm-resolving numerical simulations at 2.4 km have been performed covering the tropical Atlantic and neighboring parts for 2 months. The simulated cloud fields are combined with infrared geostationary satellite observations, and their realism is assessed with the help of object-based evaluation methods. It is shown that the simulations are able to develop a well-defined intertropical convergence zone. However, marine convective activity measured by the cold cloud coverage is considerably underestimated, especially for the winter season and the western Atlantic. The spatial coupling across the resolved scales leads to simulated cloud number size distributions that follow power laws similar to the observations, with slopes steeper in winter than summer and slopes steeper over ocean than over land. The simulated slopes are, however, too steep, indicating too many small and too few large tropical cloud cells. It is also discussed that the number of larger cells is less influenced by multiday variability of environmental conditions. Despite the identified deficits, the analyzed simulations highlight the great potential of this modeling framework for process-based studies of tropical deep convection.},

In this method, BT and BTD thresholds are used to detect severe convection and uncertain clouds, then the tracking technique including overlap ratio, minimum BT change and cross-correlation coefficient is used to detect convection activities in uncertain clouds. The Application test results show that our integrated detection method can effectively detect convective clouds in different life periods, which show a better performance than any single step in it. The statistical results show that the α-type clouds are mostly large-scale systems, and the β- and γ-type clouds have the highest proportion of general type.

A consistent temporal evolution starting with peak IC activity changing to predominant CG activity and concluding with strong outflow (microburst) suggests that ice is responsible for both the electrical (i.e., lightning) and dynamical (i.e., microburst) phenomena. The IC activity is attributed to the updraft-driven accumulation of graupel particles in the central dipole region, and the subsequent CG activity to the descent of ice particles beneath the height of the main negative charge. The subsequent descent and melting of ice particles beneath the height of the 0°C isotherm are associated with the acceleration of the downdraft and outflow. The IC lightning precursor can provide a valuable short-term (5–10 min) warning for microburst hazard at ground level.},

Results show that time series of updraft volume in the charging zone (at temperatures colder than −5°C) with vertical velocities greater than either 5 or 10 m s−1 have clear relationships with total lightning activity (r = 0.93). Furthermore, these relationships between updraft volume and lightning activity for the storm types of the two climate regimes tend to converge when considering only the subfreezing layers of the clouds. Neither the maximum nor the mean updraft speed correlate as well with total lightning activity (r = {\textless}0.8) as updraft volume. Through expanded study designed to explore further regime variability (or lack thereof) of updraft volume-lightning flash rate relationships, better or refined parameterizations for the numerical forecasting of lightning and/or detection and prediction of storm intensity could be realized.},

A new method for the identification of thunderstorm cells based on the aggregation of flashes is developed. It is found that approximately 79.1\% of CG flashes are located in the region featuring weak vertical velocity at the 0°C level, ranging from −5 to 5ms−1, with the majority in the weak updraft region, especially for negative CG lightning and the CG lightning in the initial stage of thunderstorms. The CG lightning rate is correlated with the volume of updraft for vertical velocities within certain limits. The sum of absolute precipitation ice mass flux in the region from 7 to 11km is more significantly correlated with the CG flash rate, with correlation coefficients of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.74 for the initial, mature, and dissipating stages of thunderstorms, respectively. On average, the updraft in the thunderstorm at the stage when the last CG flash occurs accounts for a much smaller ratio to the whole volume of the thunderstorm than that corresponding to the first CG flash. The maximum updraft and maximum height of the 10 and 20ms−1 updraft speeds are close for the first and last CG flashes, indicating the dependence of the lightning on strength of updraft. It is deduced that layered large-range charges may be more conducive to the generation of CG flashes than charge pockets in the thunderstorm.},

It is based on matching the probabilities of the two variables. The observed reflectivity is often very different from the true reflectivity near the surface due to the averaging of the real reflectivity field aloft by the beam, path attenuation, and variations in the drop-size distribution (DSD) between the pulse volume and the surface. The probability-matching method (PMM) inherently accounts for all of these differences on average. The formulation of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions is constrained such that 1) the radar-retrieved probability density function (PDF) of {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} is identical to the gauge-measured PDF, and 2) the traction of the time that it is raining is identical for both the radar and for simultaneous, collocated gauge measurements. This ensures that the rain measured by the radar is equal to that observed at the gauges. The resultant {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions are not constrained to be power laws.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The method was applied to data obtained by a 1.65° beamwidth C-band radar and 22 gauges located near Darwin, Australia. The data were stratified by range and also by rainfall type. The resultant {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions manifest the nature of the PDF of {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and the manner in which the beam effects the PDF of {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} through beam averaging and the average effects of C-band attenuation. In this regard, the {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions reflect the nature of the precipitation. This provides the hope for greatly improved rainfall measurements, especially for climatic purposes and for sufficiently large space-time domains. In those climates where the storms closely resemble one another, the relations may be used for individual storms over their lifetime or for a few storms at any one moment.

The National Center for Atmospheric Research CP-3 and CP-4 radars are used to calculate median VPRR for MCSs in the Oklahoma-Kansas Preliminary Regional Experiment for STORM-Central in 1985. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere radar in Darwin, Australia, is used to calculate VPRR for MCSs observed both in oceanic, monsoon regimes and in continental, break period regimes during the wet seasons of 1987/88 and 1988/89.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The midlatitude and tropical continental VPRRs both exhibit maximum reflectivity somewhat above the surface and have a gradual decrease in reflectivity with height above the freezing level. In sharp contrast, the tropical oceanic profile has a maximum reflectivity at the lowest level and a very rapid decrease in reflectivity with height beginning just above the freezing level. The tropical oceanic profile in the Darwin area is almost the same shape as that for two other tropical oceanic regimes, leading to the conclusion that it is characteristic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The absolute values of reflectivity in the 0° to −20°C range are compared with values in the literature thought to represent a threshold for rapid storm electrification leading to lightning, about 40 dBZ at −10°C. Most oceanic cells have reflectivities below the threshold; most midlatitude continental cells exceed the threshold, and the tropical continental cells are about equally divided above and below the threshold. The large negative vertical gradient of reflectivity in this temperature range for oceanic storms is hypothesized to be a direct result of the characteristically weaker vertical velocities observed in MCSs over tropical oceans. It is proposed, as a necessary condition for rapid electrification, that a convective cell must have its updraft speed exceed some threshold value. Based upon field program data, a tentative estimate for the magnitude of this threshold is 6–7 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ for mean speed and 10–12 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ for peak speed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Scene pixel data used in the analysis are first screened to ensure they meet the low-light criteria and to minimize scene temporal variability associated with meteorological evolution and geolocation uncertainty in highly inhomogeneous scenes. After such screening, image-to-image radiance time difference statistics are compiled and analyzed to estimate instrument SNR. Based on GOES-R ABI vendor prelaunch testing, minimum and mean expected ABI Ch 2 postlaunch SNR performance at 5\% albedo was estimated to be 44.2 and 64.5, respectively. Meanwhile, the SNR computed in this analysis is found to be about 57 ± 8. Thus, low-light SNR for ABI Ch 2 is shown to meet minimum user expectations. The analysis for the other five GOES-16 ABI VNIR channels is also shown to contrast the SNR for these channels.},

Statistical analyses show that previously published conclusions that increasing CN concentrations cause a decrease in minimum cloud-top temperature (CTT) at the SGP site through the aerosol convective invigoration effect are unfounded. The CN–CTT relationship is statistically insignificant, while correlations between convective available potential energy (CAPE), level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), and CN concentration account for most of the change in the CN–CTT positive correlation. Removal of clouds with minimum CTTs {\textgreater} −36°C from the analysis eliminates the CN–CTT correlation. Composited dirty conditions at the SGP have {\textasciitilde}1°C-warmer low levels and {\textasciitilde}1°C-cooler upper levels than clean conditions. This correlation between aerosol concentrations and thermodynamic profiles may be caused by an increase in regional rainfall preceding deep convective conditions as CN concentration decreases. Increased rainfall can be expected to increase wet deposition of aerosols, cool low-level temperatures, and warm upper-level temperatures. The masking of a potential aerosol effect by such small thermodynamic changes implies that the strategy of analyzing subsets of aerosol data by binned meteorological factor values is not a valid method for discerning an aerosol effect in some situations. These findings highlight the need for more careful, detailed, and strategic observations to confidently isolate and quantify an aerosol deep convective invigoration effect.},

By analyzing radiative–convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {The surface temperature of Earth is being increased by human activities, principally by the release of greenhouse gases (1). Future warming will depend upon the rate at which greenhouse gases are released and the sensitivity of Earth’s surface temperature to those increased greenhouse gases. An often used metric of the sensitivity of Earth’s climate is the equilibrium climate sensitivity, the amount of global average surface warming that is the steady, long-term response to a doubling of carbon dioxide. The equilibrium climate sensitivity remains uncertain by about a factor of two, despite decades of study using evidence from basic theory, instrumental observations, paleoclimatic data, and global climate models (2). Global climate models indicate that a large contributor to uncertainty in climate sensitivity is the strength of cloud feedbacks. Cloud feedback is a response of cloud structure or amount to warming, which then alters the energy balance of Earth, which causes an additional change of surface temperature. An advance was made in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that cloud feedback is likely positive, meaning that the response of clouds to climate change acts to increase the magnitude of the surface temperature change (3). This consensus is based in part on the development of basic physical understanding of why high clouds get higher (4) and low clouds decrease their area coverage in a warmed climate (5, 6). In PNAS, Bony et al. (7) propose a basic thermodynamic mechanism that may cause the temperature profile to become more stable in the upper troposphere when the Earth warms. They expect this stabilization to cause anvil cloud area to decrease in a warmed climate, although they conclude that the effect of this anvil area reduction on cloud feedback is uncertain.

	abstract = {Cloud feedback—the change in top-of-atmosphere radiative flux resulting from the cloud response to warming—constitutes by far the largest source of uncertainty in the climate response to CO2 forcing simulated by global climate models (GCMs). We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

	abstract = {The net radiative effects of tropical clouds are determined by the evolution of thick, freshly detrained anvil clouds into thin anvil clouds. Thick anvil clouds reduce Earth's energy balance and cool the climate, while thin anvil clouds warm the climate. To determine role of these clouds in climate change we need to understand how interactions of their microphysical and macrophysical properties control their radiative properties. We explore anvil cloud evolution using a cloud-resolving model in three-simulation setups of increasing complexity to disentangle the impacts of the various components of diabatic heating and their interaction with cloud-scale motions. The first phase of evolution and rapid cloud spreading is dominated by latent heating within convective updrafts. After the convective detrainment stops, most of the spreading and thinning of the anvil cloud is driven by cloud radiative processes and latent heating. The combination of radiative cooling at cloud top, latent cooling due to sublimation at cloud base, latent heating due to deposition and radiative heating in between leads to a sandwich-like, cooling-heating-cooling structure. The heating sandwich promotes the development of two within-anvil convective layers and a double cell circulation, dominated by strong outflow at 12-km altitude with inflow above and below. Our study reveals how small-scale processes including convective, microphysical processes, latent and radiative heating interact within the anvil cloud system. The absence or a different representation of only one component results in a significantly different cloud evolution with large impacts on cloud radiative effects.},

Using data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) imaging radiometer aboard a geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, dynamical and microphysical properties of developing storms were monitored and combined. Several satellite-based storm properties, for example, cloud-top temperature, cloud-top cooling rate, and cloud particle effective radius, were investigated following the storm tracks. A framework for quantification of uncertainties of along-track properties resulting from tracking errors was also introduced. The majority of studied storms show a distinct maximum in cloud-top cooling rate; the corresponding time was used for track synchronization. The cloud growth phase was divided into an initial updraft intensification period before the maximum cooling and a continued growth period afterward. The initial updraft intensification period is variable and strongly depends on the convection initiation mechanism and detection conditions. The continued growth period is more confined, lasting between 30 and 45 min. The change in anvil size and the resulting average anvil edge velocity were determined from infrared satellite images. As a consequence of mass transport, the anvil edge velocity shows its highest correlation with the cloud-top vertical velocity approximately 20–30 min after the maximum in the cloud-top cooling rate. Larger effective radii of ice crystals were observed for vertically slower-growing clouds. The largest anticorrelation between cloud-top vertical velocity and effective radius was found at a time lag of 20 min after the maximum in cloud-top cooling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Dynamical growth properties as well as cloud-top glaciation and microphysical characteristics are derived from the SEVIRI imaging radiometer aboard the geostationary Meteosat satellites. In addition, onset and intensity of surface precipitation are related to growth and glaciation processes using observations from the radar network of the German Weather Service. The majority of analyzed cases shows a distinct maximum in cloud-top cooling rate, which is used here for temporal synchronization. Cloud growth spans a period of approximately half an hour. Glaciation rate indicators suggest that freezing 15 min prior to the maximum cooling plays an important role in invigorating convective updrafts through the release of latent heat. Smaller ice particles are found for larger cloud-top cooling, which provides observational evidence that ice particles form later and have less time to grow in stronger convective updrafts. Furthermore, maximum cloud-top height, anvil expansion rate, maximum precipitation intensity, and core size are found to be positively correlated. With respect to the onset of precipitation, this analysis shows a high probability that significant precipitation already occurs 30 min prior to maximum cloud-top cooling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Deep convective systems (DCSs) consist of intense convective cores (CC), large stratiform rain (SR) regions, and extensive nonprecipitating anvil clouds (AC). This study focuses on the evolution of these three components and the factors that affect system lifetime and AC production. An automated satellite tracking method is used in conjunction with a recently developed multisensor hybrid classification to analyze the evolution of DCS structure in a Lagrangian framework over the central United States. Composite analysis from 4221 tracked DCSs during two warm seasons (May–August, 2010–2011) shows that maximum system size correlates with lifetime, and longer-lived DCSs have more extensive SR and AC. For short to medium systems (lifetimes {\textless}6 h), the lifetime is mainly attributed to the intensity of the initial convection. Systems that last longer than 6 h are associated with up to 50\% higher midtropospheric relative humidity and up to 40\% stronger middle to upper tropospheric wind shear. Such environments allow continuous growth of detrained hydrometeors by deposition, supporting further development of the SR and AC region, as indicated by the increased staggered timing between stratiform clouds and peak convective intensity, thus prolonging the system lifetime beyond 6 h. Regression analysis shows that the areal coverage of thick AC is strongly correlated with the size of CC, updraft strength, and SR area. Ambient upper tropospheric wind speed and wind shear also play an important role for convective AC production, where for systems with large AC (radius {\textgreater}120 km) they are 24\% and 20\% higher, respectively, than those with small AC (radius = 20 km).},

	abstract = {This study develops an understanding on how retrieved cloud parameter fields from the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) algorithm, operating on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, behave at 5-min time resolutions for growing cumulus clouds. Fields retrieved by the OCA algorithm include cloud optical thickness (τ), cloud-top particle effective radius (re), cloud-top pressure (pc), and cloud-top phase. OCA is based on a one-dimensional optimal estimation methodology, and a measure of radiance fit, the cost function (Jm), is a quantity developed as part of the retrieval process and is shown to be useful in delineating mixed phase clouds; it too is evaluated (at 5-min intervals) for the information it provides. Data for 94 growing cumulus cloud events are processed. An “event” is defined as a cumulus cloud that is monitored at 5-min intervals with OCA, as it grows from the “fair weather” or “towering cumulus” stage to near the cumulonimbus stage when precipitation begins. The hypothesis is that OCA products are of high-enough quality to provide unique information about microphysical processes occurring at and near cloud top. The goal through analysis of the 94 events is to identify consistent, repeating patterns in OCA fields during cloud growth that can be in turn used to infer physical processes. Data from the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (June and July 2007) and in four regions of Europe on 25 May 2009 are used. The validity of the OCA data is presented with a comparison to CloudSat Precipitation Radar and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrieved cloud properties, showing good statistical agreements. Subsequently, results from the analysis of OCA fields for all events show that as cumuli deepen, re values tend to increase, and then decrease in size as cloud tops glaciate and particle settling begins. The τ magnitudes generally increase as clouds deepen, while pc values and cloud-top temperatures fall as expected. The Jm values exhibit the pattern of spiking in magnitude (over a 5–10-min period), which indicates the increase “misfit” within OCA during the mixed phase, at about the time τ values increase substantially as clouds deepen.},

Long-lived and intense MCSs account for over 50\% of warm season precipitation in the Great Plains and over 40\% of cold season precipitation in the southeast. The Great Plains has the strongest MCS seasonal cycle peaking in May–June, whereas in the U.S. southeast MCSs occur year-round. Distinctly different large-scale environments across the seasons have significant impacts on the structure of MCSs. Spring and fall MCSs commonly initiate under strong baroclinic forcing and favorable thermodynamic environments. MCS genesis frequently occurs in the Great Plains near sunset, although convection is not always surface based. Spring MCSs feature both large and deep convection, with a large stratiform rain area and high volume of rainfall. In contrast, summer MCSs often initiate under weak baroclinic forcing, featuring a high pressure ridge with weak low-level convergence acting on the warm, humid air associated with the low-level jet. MCS genesis concentrates east of the Rocky Mountain Front Range and near the southeast coast in the afternoon. The strongest MCS diurnal cycle amplitude extends from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains. Summer MCSs have the largest and deepest convective features, the smallest stratiform rain area, and the lowest rainfall volume. Last, winter MCSs are characterized by the strongest baroclinic forcing and the largest MCS precipitation features over the southeast. Implications of the findings for climate modeling are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Increasing global precipitation has been associated with a warming climate resulting from a strengthening of the hydrological cycle1. This increase, however, is not spatially uniform. Observations and models have found that changes in rainfall show patterns characterized as ‘wet-gets-wetter’1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and ‘warmer-gets-wetter’5,8,9. These changes in precipitation are largely located in the tropics and hence are probably associated with convection. However, the underlying physical processes for the observed changes are not entirely clear. Here we show from observations that most of the regional increase in tropical precipitation is associated with changes in the frequency of organized deep convection. By assessing the contributions of various convective regimes to precipitation, we find that the spatial patterns of change in the frequency of organized deep convection are strongly correlated with observed change in rainfall, both positive and negative (correlation of 0.69), and can explain most of the patterns of increase in rainfall. In contrast, changes in less organized forms of deep convection or changes in precipitation within organized deep convection contribute less to changes in precipitation. Our results identify organized deep convection as the link between changes in rainfall and in the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere, thus providing a framework for obtaining a better understanding of changes in rainfall. Given the lack of a distinction between the different degrees of organization of convection in climate models10, our results highlight an area of priority for future climate model development in order to achieve accurate rainfall projections in a warming climate.},

For DCC at or below the tropopause the onset temperature of this process shifts at the same rate as the increase in the mean SST. For tropopause overshooting DCC, which are associated with extreme rain events, the shift of the onset temperature is slower, causing their frequency to increase by about 21\%/K of warming of the oceans. This sensitivity is not inconsistent with the sensitivity of the increase of extreme deep convective rain in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model version 5 model for a warmer SST. The mean of the 36 fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models predicts a 2.7 K warmer tropical SST by the end of this century, resulting in a 60\% increases in the frequency of tropopause overshooting DCC.},

Historically, little attention has been paid to the intense convective storms in the high latitudes. These regions have been experiencing the largest increases of mean surface temperature over the last century. The Global Precipitation Measurement core satellite, which features a space-borne Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar providing near-global coverage (65°S to 65°N), has made it possible to establish the occurrence of convective storms at high latitudes. Analysis of the three-dimensional radar echoes seen by Global Precipitation Measurement over a 5-year period (2014–2018) shows that extremely intense deep convective storms do occur often during the warm season (April–September) in the high-latitude continents where the increase of surface temperature has been greatest. The associated thermodynamical environments suggest that high-latitude extreme convection could be more common in a continually warming world.},

	abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR “Water Cycle Across Scales” initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.},

	abstract = {The response of the hydrological cycle to climate forcings can be understood within the atmospheric energy budget framework. In this study precipitation and energy budget responses to five forcing agents are analyzed using 10 climate models from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). Precipitation changes are split into a forcing-dependent fast response and a temperature-driven hydrological sensitivity. Globally, when normalized by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) forcing, fast precipitation changes are most sensitive to strongly absorbing drivers (CO2, black carbon). However, over land fast precipitation changes are most sensitive to weakly absorbing drivers (sulfate, solar) and are linked to rapid circulation changes. Despite this, land-mean fast responses to CO2 and black carbon exhibit more intermodel spread. Globally, the hydrological sensitivity is consistent across forcings, mainly associated with increased longwave cooling, which is highly correlated with intermodel spread. The land-mean hydrological sensitivity is weaker, consistent with limited moisture availability. The PDRMIP results are used to construct a simple model for land-mean and sea-mean precipitation change based on sea surface temperature change and TOA forcing. The model matches well with CMIP5 ensemble mean historical and future projections, and is used to understand the contributions of different drivers. During the twentieth century, temperature-driven intensification of land-mean precipitation has been masked by fast precipitation responses to anthropogenic sulfate and volcanic forcing, consistent with the small observed trend. However, as projected sulfate forcing decreases, and warming continues, land-mean precipitation is expected to increase more rapidly, and may become clearly observable by the mid-twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {What can we say about changes in the hydrologic cycle on 50-year timescales when we cannot predict rainfall next week? Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short-term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large-scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.},

While the large-scale flow establishes environmental conditions favorable for severe weather, processes on the mesoscale initiate such storms, affect their evolution, and influence their environment. A rich variety of mesocale processes are involved in severe weather, ranging from environmental preconditioning to storm initiation to feedback of convection on the environment. In the space available, it is not possible to treat all of these processes in detail. Rather, we will introduce several general classifications of mesoscale processes relating to severe weather and give illustrative examples. Although processes on the mesoscale are often intimately linked with those on smaller and larger scales, we will exclude from discussion those that obviously lie outside the mesoscale domain (e.g., baroclinic waves on the synoptic scale or charge separation in clouds on the microscale).},

	abstract = {Conventional surface data and quantitative estimations of precipitation are used to document the occurrence and spatial distribution of severe weather phenomena associated with deep moist convection over southeastern South America. Data used in this paper are 24-hour rainfall, maximum hourly gusts and present weather reports from the surface station network for Argentina to the north of 40°S and cover the period 2000–2005. Hourly rainfall estimated with the CMORPH technique (CPC MORPHing technique, R. J. Joyce et al., 2004) is included in the analysis in order to increase the density of the precipitation database from January 2003 to December 2005. Extreme events are detected by means of a 95th-percentile analysis of the 24-hour rainfall and wind; values greater than 30mm and 25ms−1 respectively are considered extreme in the study area. These results are related to the presence of deep convection by considering the 235K and 218K cloud shield evolution in Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-12 Infrared (GOES-IR) imagery evaluated by the Forecasting and Tracking of Cloud Cluster (FORTRACC) technique. Rainfall above 30mmday−1 and present convection-related weather events tend to occur in the northeast of the country. Finally, an analysis is made of the relationship between severe phenomena and the location and lifecycle of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) defined by the 218K or 235K levels. According to the reports, favorable locations for severe weather concentrate to the northeast of the cloud shield anvil centroid although most of the cases are found in the northwest. This feature can be seen in systems with anvil areas larger than 250,000km2 in association to the predominant mid-level wind shear direction from the northwest over the area. Moreover, systems with centers located north of 30°S present a more circular shape while those to the south are more elongated with a NW–SE main axis clearly related to the presence and interaction with frontal zones over the area. Most of the events occur previous to the moment when the systems reach their maximum extension, between 2 and 10h after the initiation of the system depending on the size of the MCSs.},

Due to the local-scale extent of hail-affected areas and a lack of appropriate observing systems in most regions, hailstorms are not captured accurately and comprehensively, which makes statistical analysis of their frequency or climatology more difficult. Various studies have been conducted so far to describe and analyze the frequency of hailstorms or related impacts. These studies, however, refer to a wide range of spatial scales and consider different time periods, investigation methods, or hailstone diameters. This article will give a comprehensive overview and review of the present state of knowledge on hail hazard and hail frequency over recent decades up to centuries across Europe and is intended as a reference for future studies. We attempted to summarize and synthesize the various prevailing studies with the objective to identify regions that are most prone to hail hazard. Another focus is put on mechanisms that may explain spatial variability and inhomogeneities in hail frequency observed across various spatial scales.},

Break period convection consists primarily of deep continental convection, whereas oceanic-based convection dominates during monsoonal periods, associated with the monsoon trough over Darwin. Order-of-magnitude enhancements in lightning flash rates for the “break period” regime are associated with 10–20-dB enhancements in radar reflectivity in the mixed-phase region of the convection compared with the monsoonal regime. The latter differences are attributed to the effect of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and its nonlinear influence on the growth and accumulation of ice particles aloft, which are believed to promote charge separation by differential particle motions. CAPE, in turn, is largely determined by the boundary-layer wet-bulb temperature. Modest differences (1°–3°C) in wet-bulb potential temperature between land and sea may account for the order-of-magnitude contrast in recently observed land–ocean lightning activity.},

	abstract = {Observations from a geostationary satellite are used to study the life cycle of mesoscale convective systems (MCS), their associated anvil clouds, and their effects on the radiation balance over the warm pool of the tropical western Pacific Ocean. In their developing stages, MCS primarily consist of clouds that are optically thick and have a negative net cloud radiative effect (CRE). As MCS age, ice crystals in the anvil become larger, the cloud top lowers somewhat, and cloud radiative effects decrease in magnitude. Shading from anvils causes cool anomalies in the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) of up to −0.6°C. MCS often occur in clusters that are embedded within large westward-propagating disturbances, and therefore shading from anvils can cool SSTs over regions spanning hundreds of kilometers. Triggering of convection is more likely to follow a warm SST anomaly than a cold SST anomaly on a time scale of several days. This information is used to evaluate hypotheses for why, over the warm pool, the average shortwave and longwave CRE are individually large but nearly cancel. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cancellation in CRE is caused by feedbacks among cloud albedo, large-scale circulation, and SST.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Quantitative precipitation nowcasting (QPN) has become an essential technique in various application contexts, such as early warning or urban sewage control. A common heuristic prediction approach is to track the motion of precipitation features from a sequence of weather radar images and then to displace the precipitation field to the imminent future (minutes to hours) based on that motion, assuming that the intensity of the features remains constant (“Lagrangian persistence”). In that context, “optical flow” has become one of the most popular tracking techniques. Yet the present landscape of computational QPN models still struggles with producing open software implementations. Focusing on this gap, we have developed and extensively benchmarked a stack of models based on different optical flow algorithms for the tracking step and a set of parsimonious extrapolation procedures based on image warping and advection. We demonstrate that these models provide skillful predictions comparable with or even superior to state-of-the-art operational software. Our software library (“rainymotion”) for precipitation nowcasting is written in the Python programming language and openly available at GitHub ({\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}https://github.com/hydrogo/rainymotion{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, {\textless}span class="cit" id="xref\_altparen.1"{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx3"{\textgreater}Ayzel et al.{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, {\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx3"{\textgreater}2019{\textless}/a{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). That way, the library may serve as a tool for providing fast, free, and transparent solutions that could serve as a benchmark for further model development and hypothesis testing – a benchmark that is far more advanced than the conventional benchmark of Eulerian persistence commonly used in QPN verification experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A new advection-based nowcasting scheme for precipitation has been developed for the Gandolf system. The method employed removes the need to split the radar analysis into contiguous rain areas (CRA's) and uses a smoothness constraint. Thus, it is similar to the Variational Echo Tracking approach. Optical flow ideas are used to diagnose the advection velocity of blocks within rain analyses, which involve the direct solution of the Lagrangian persistence equation. In block-based approaches, the radar analyses are partitioned a-priori and a CRA may be split over a number of blocks. This scheme is compared with the old Gandolf advection scheme, which is based on CRA's, and the new scheme performs better-both in cases associated with severe flooding and over a continuous verification period of 3 months. The benefit is conjectured to be due mainly to the difficulty in unambiguously identifying CRA's, which is particularly troublesome on small domains, such as the UK. Thus, it is concluded that block-based methods are likely to be superior to object-based methods in the majority of cases.},

	abstract = {Hong Kong Observatory has been operating an in-house developed rainfall nowcasting system called “Short-range Warning of Intense Rainstorms in Localized Systems (SWIRLS)” to support rainstorm warning and rainfall nowcasting services. A crucial step in rainfall nowcasting is the tracking of radar echoes to generate motion fields for extrapolation of rainfall areas in the following few hours. SWIRLS adopted a correlation-based method in its first operational version in 1999, which was subsequently replaced by optical flow algorithm in 2010 and further enhanced in 2013. The latest optical flow algorithm employs a transformation function to enhance a selected range of reflectivity for feature tracking. It also adopts variational optical flow computation that takes advantage of the Horn–Schunck approach and the Lucas–Kanade method. This paper details the three radar echo tracking algorithms, examines their performances in several significant rainstorm cases and summaries verification results of multi-year performances. The limitations of the current approach are discussed. Developments underway along with future research areas are also presented.},

	abstract = {The atmospheric state evolution is an inherently highly complex three-dimensional problem that numerical weather prediction (NWP) models attempt to solve. Although NWP models are being successfully employed for medium- and long-range forecast, their short-duration forecast (or nowcast) capabilities are still limited because of model initialization challenges. On the lower end of the complexity scale, nowcasting by extrapolation of two-dimensional weather radar images has long been the most effective tool for nowcasting precipitation. Attempts are being made to take advantage of both approaches by blending extrapolation and numerical model forecasts. In this work a different approach is presented, relying on the additional Doppler radar wind information and a simplified modeling of basic physical processes. Instead of mixing the outputs of different forecasts as in blended approaches, the idea behind this study is to combine extrapolation and precipitation modeling in a new technique with a higher level of complexity with respect to conventional nowcasting methods, although still much simpler than NWP models. As a preliminary step, the Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS) is used to provide an initial analysis exploiting all the available dual-polarization and Doppler radar observations. The rainwater and wind fields are then advected using an optical flow technique that is subject to simplified physical interactions. As a result precipitation and wind nowcasting are obtained and are successively validated up to a 1-h lead time, showing potential improvement upon standard extrapolation.},
