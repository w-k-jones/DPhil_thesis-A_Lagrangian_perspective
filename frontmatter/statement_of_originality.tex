\begin{originality}

I hereby declare that, to the best of my knowledge, all work contained in this thesis is my own, original contribution, unless otherwise stated.

Chapter \ref{chp:tracking_method} is adapted from the article ``A semi-Lagrangian method for detecting and tracking deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite observations'' \citep{jones_semi-lagrangian_2023}. In this article, I (William Jones) led the development of the detection and tracking framework, data analysis and validation, and wrote the paper with contributions from Matthew Christensen and Philip Stier.

Chapter \ref{chp:radiative_effect} is adapted from the article ``A Lagrangian Perspective on the Lifecycle and Cloud Radiative Effect of Deep Convective Clouds Over Africa'' \citep{jones_lagrangian_2023}. In this article, I (William Jones) designed the study. Martin Stengel provided the retrieved cloud properties and radiative fluxes from Meteosat SEVIRI data. I performed the detection and tracking and the data analysis, and wrote the paper with contributions from Martin Stengel and Philip Stier.
