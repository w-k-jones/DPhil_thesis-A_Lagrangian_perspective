I hereby declare that, to the best of my knowledge, all work contained in this thesis is my own, original contribution, unless otherwise stated.

Chapter \ref{chp:tracking_method} is adapted from the article ``A semi-Lagrangian method for detecting and tracking deep convective clouds in geostationary satellite observations'' \citep{jones_semi-lagrangian_2023}. In this article, William Jones led the development of the detection and tracking framework, data analysis and validation, and wrote the paper with contributions from Matthew Christensen and Philip Stier.
