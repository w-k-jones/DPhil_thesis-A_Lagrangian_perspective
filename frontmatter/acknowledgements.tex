I would like to thank my supervisor, Philip Stier, for his excellent mentorship and for allowing me the freedom to explore the many aspects of cloud and storm physics.
The path to writing this thesis has been far from the easiest one, and I would not have made it without such a supportive supervisor.
Matt Christensen, my co-advisor and colleague, has provided support and inspiration throughout, and shared with me his interest in the study of clouds through the lens of satellite observations.

There are numerous colleagues, office--mates and mentors who have contributed to my work and helped in many ways. 
The \textit{tobac} development team, including, but not limited to, Max Heikenfeld, Fabian Senf, Sean Freeman, Julia Kukulies and Kelcy Brunner have greatly helped shape the development of the approaches used within the study the properties of deep convective clouds.
Sue van den Heever and Graeme Stephens have provided many insightful discussions on the behaviour of deep convection, which in particular inspired the contents of chapter~\ref{chp:anvil_structure}.
Martin Stengel and the ESA Cloud-CCI+ team provided the cloud retrievals that made chapter~\ref{chp:radiative_effect} possible, and helped in the development of this research.

I am very grateful to Don Grainger and Johannes Quaas for volunteering their time as my examiners, and for their considered feedback that has helped greatly improve this thesis.

I give thanks to my parents, Rosie and Stephen, for their continued guidance, love and support, even if they couldn't convince me that there were options other than Physics.

Finally, but most importantly, I would like to thank my partner Cat for her love and support during times both happy and challenging.
