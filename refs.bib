At sub-yearly timescales, all correlations underlying these four results decrease abruptly towards negligible values. Such a transition has important implications for understanding and quantifying the climate sensitivity of the global hydrological cycle. The validity of the derived correlation structure is demonstrated by reconstructing global precipitation time series at 2-year resolution, relying on the emergent strong correlations ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} vs. clear-sky DLR). Such a simple linear sensitivity model was able to reproduce observed {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} anomaly time series with similar accuracy to an (uncoupled) atmospheric model (ERA-20CM) and two climate reanalysis (ERA-20C and 20CR). The linear sensitivity breaks down at sub-yearly timescales, whereby the underlying correlations become negligible. Finally, the relevance of the multi-scale framework and its potential for stochastic downscaling applications are demonstrated by deriving accurate monthly {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} probability density functions (PDFs) from the reconstructed 2-year {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{P}{\textless}/span{\textgreater} time series based on scale-invariant arguments alone.

	abstract = {The aerosol radiative effects (ARE) on the deep convective clouds are investigated by using a spectral-bin cloud-resolving model coupled with a radiation scheme and an explicit land surface model. The sensitivity of cloud properties and the associated radiative forcing to aerosol single-scattering albedo (SSA) are examined. The ARE on cloud properties is pronounced for mid-visible SSA of 0.85. Relative to the case without ARE, the cloud fraction and optical depth decrease by about 18\% and 20\%, respectively. Ice particle number concentrations, liquid water path, ice water path, and droplet size decrease by more than 15\% when the ARE is introduced. The ARE causes a surface cooling of about 0.35 K and significantly high heating rates in the lower troposphere (about 0.6 K day−1 higher at 2 km), both of which lead to a more stable atmosphere and hence weaker convection. The weaker convection explains the less cloudiness, lower cloud optical depth, less LWP and IWP, smaller droplet size, and less precipitation resulting from the ARE. The daytime-mean direct forcing induced by black carbon is about 2.2 W m−2 at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and −17.4 W m−2 at the surface for SSA of 0.85. The semi-direct forcing is positive, about 10 and 11.2 W m−2 at the TOA and surface, respectively. Both the TOA and surface total radiative forcing values are strongly negative for the deep convective clouds, attributed mostly to aerosol indirect forcing. Aerosol direct and semi-direct effects are very sensitive to SSA when aerosol optical depth is high. Because the positive semi-direct forcing compensates the negative direct forcing at the surface, the surface temperature and heat fluxes decrease less significantly with the increase of aerosol absorption (decreasing SSA). The cloud fraction, optical depth, convective strength, and precipitation decrease with the increase of absorption, resulting from a more stable atmosphere due to enhanced surface cooling and atmospheric heating.},

	abstract = {Impacts of absorbing and scattering aerosols on global energy balance are investigated with a global climate model. A series of sensitivity experiments perturbing emissions of black carbon and sulfate aerosols individually is conducted with the model to explore how components of global energy budget change in response to the instantaneous radiative forcing due to the two types of aerosols. It is demonstrated how differing vertical structures of the instantaneous radiative forcing between the two aerosols induce distinctively different proportions of fast and slow climate responses through different energy redistribution into atmosphere and surface. These characteristics are quantified in the form of the whole picture of global energy budget perturbations normalized by the top-of-atmosphere instantaneous radiative forcing. The energy budget perturbation per “unit” instantaneous forcing thus quantified reveals relative magnitudes of changes to different component fluxes in restoring atmospheric and surface energy balances through fast and slow responses. The normalized picture then directly links the “initial forcing” to the eventual climate “responses,” thereby explaining how starkly different responses of the global-mean temperature and precipitation are induced by the two types of aerosols. The study underscores a critical need for better quantifications of the forcings' vertical structure and atmospheric rapid adjustment for reliable estimates of climatic impact of absorbing and scattering aerosols. In particular, cloud responses through the indirect and semidirect effects and the sensible heat decrease in response to stabilized atmosphere due to the black carbon heating are identified as key uncertain components in the global energy budget perturbation.},

	abstract = {From recent satellite observations, it is evident that an increase in cloud condensation nuclei—for instance, due to biomass burning—can substantially reduce rain efficiency of convective clouds. This is potentially important for the global climate since the release of latent heat due to condensation of water vapour and fallout of rain from cumulus convection is the most important source for available potential energy in the free troposphere. Beyond this, cumulus convection is a key process in controlling the water vapour content of the atmosphere. The sensitivity of the global climate to modification in rain efficiency of convective clouds due to the suppression of drop coalescence by anthropogenic aerosols is studied by using the atmospheric general circulation model (A-GCM), ECHAM4. This paper presents results from a 15-year sensitivity study, which considers the aerosol effect on warm precipitation formation. Effects on ice processes are not included yet, and therefore the results likely underestimate the magnitude of the full effects due to suppression of precipitation. Instantaneous forcing is large locally (up to 100\% reduction of precipitation and the related latent heat release) but confined to small areas, leading to small large-scale mean anomalies in the convective heating and therefore the vertical temperature gradient. We found a definite perturbation of the global circulation, showing distinct sensitivity to the impact of aerosols on suppressing rainfall.},

We used a series of climate model experiments to investigate the South Asian monsoon response to natural and anthropogenic forcings. We find that the observed precipitation decrease can be attributed mainly to human-influenced aerosol emissions. The drying is a robust outcome of a slowdown of the tropical meridional overturning circulation, which compensates for the aerosol-induced energy imbalance between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These results provide compelling evidence of the prominent role of aerosols in shaping regional climate change over South Asia.

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean. Evaluations of atmospheric reanalyses reveal substantial biases.},

	abstract = {Influence of pollution on dynamics of deep convection continues to be a controversial topic. Arguably, only carefully designed numerical simulations can clearly separate the impact of aerosols from the effects of meteorological factors that affect moist convection. This paper argues that such a separation is virtually impossible using observations because of the insufficient accuracy of atmospheric measurements and the fundamental nature of the interaction between deep convection and its environment. To support this conjecture, results from numerical simulations are presented that apply modeling methodology previously developed by the author. The simulations consider small modifications, difficult to detect in observations, of the initial sounding, surface fluxes, and large-scale forcing tendencies. All these represent variations of meteorological conditions that affect deep convective dynamics independently of aerosols. The setup follows the case of daytime convective development over land based on observations during the Large-Scale Biosphere–Atmosphere (LBA) field project in Amazonia. The simulated observable macroscopic changes of convection, such as the surface precipitation and upper-tropospheric cloudiness, are similar to or larger than those resulting from changes of cloud condensation nuclei from pristine to polluted conditions studied previously using the same modeling case. Observations from Phase III of the Global Atmospheric Research Program Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) are also used to support the argument concerning the impact of the large-scale forcing. The simulations suggest that the aerosol impacts on dynamics of deep convection cannot be isolated from meteorological effects, at least for the daytime development of unorganized deep convection considered in this study.},

	abstract = {Many different interactions between aerosols and clouds have been postulated, based on correlations between satellite retrieved aerosol and cloud properties. Previous studies highlighted the importance of meteorological covariations to the observed correlations.  In this work, we make use of multiple temporally-spaced satellite retrievals to observe the development of cloud regimes. The observation of cloud regime development allows us to account for the influences of cloud fraction (CF) and meteorological factors on the aerosol retrieval. By accounting for the aerosol index (AI)-CF relationship, we reduce the influence of meteorological correlations compared to "snapshot" studies, finding that simple correlations overestimate any aerosol effect on CF by at least a factor of two.  We find an increased occurrence of transitions into the stratocumulus regime over ocean with increases in MODIS AI, consistent with the hypothesis that aerosols increase stratocumulus persistence. We also observe an increase in transitions into the deep convective regime over land, consistent with the aerosol invigoration hypothesis. We find changes in the transitions from the shallow cumulus regime in different aerosol environments. The strength of these changes is strongly dependent on Low Troposphere Static Stability and 10 m windspeed, but less so on other meteorological factors.  Whilst we have reduced the error due to meteorological and CF effects on the aerosol retrieval, meteorological covariation with the cloud and aerosol properties is harder to remove, so these results likely represent an upper bound on the effect of aerosols on cloud development and CF.},

	abstract = {The evolution of subtropical stratocumulus clouds and the boundary layer is studied on daily time scales from the Lagrangian perspective, following the flow. Measures of humidity above the boundary layer and of inversion strength are obtained from reanalysis data, and their effects on the Lagrangian evolution of cloud cover and the boundary layer are compared. An analysis that disentangles these variables and tests their effects independently is developed. Increased inversion strength and increased humidity above the boundary layer lead to anomalously persistent cloud cover and slower Lagrangian deepening of the boundary layer. These parameters affect the stratocumulus boundary layer in different ways: inversion strength controls the buoyancy difference across the inversion, while humidity differences affect both the radiation balance and rate of cloud drop evaporation at cloud top. The relative strengths of the two effects of humidity are compared using two products: the entraining humidity in the layer directly above the inversion and the radiating humidity, which is the mean humidity in the column above the entraining humidity. Results show that the variability in the radiating humidity is the primary driver of Lagrangian boundary layer depth changes, but entraining humidity variation is mostly responsible for altering cloud lifetime.},

Increased aerosol can enhance solar reflection from clouds countering greenhouse gas warming. Recently, this indirect effect has been extended from water droplet clouds to other types including mixed-phase clouds. Aerosol effects on mixed-phase clouds are important because of their fundamental role on sea ice loss and polar climate change, but very little is known about aerosol effects on these clouds. Here we provide the first analysis of the effects of aerosol emitted from ship stacks into mixed-phase clouds. Satellite observations of solar reflection in numerous ship tracks reveal that cloud albedo increases 5 times more in liquid clouds when polluted and persist 2 h longer than in mixed-phase clouds. These results suggest that seeding mixed-phase clouds via shipping aerosol is unlikely to provide any significant counterbalancing solar radiative cooling effects in warming polar regions.},

In the CALIOP Level 2 product this missing low-backscatter aerosol results in the retrieved aerosol distribution significantly overrepresenting aerosol backscatter and extinction in the middle and upper troposphere if taken to be representative of the undetected aerosol. The CALIOP Level 3 product assumes no aerosol where none is detected, which then leads to an underestimation in the aerosol extinction profile in the upper troposphere. Using the ECHAM-HAM GCM, we estimate that the mean fraction of aerosol undetected by CALIOP daytime (nighttime) retrievals is 41\% (44\%) globally.},

Knowledge of the global abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) is fundamental to determine the strength of the anthropogenic climate perturbation. Direct measurements are limited and sample only a very small fraction of the globe so that remote sensing from satellites and ground-based instruments is widely used as a proxy for cloud condensation nuclei (Nakajima et al., 2001; Andreae, 2009; Clarke and Kapustin, 2010; Boucher et al., 2013). However, the underlying assumptions cannot be robustly tested with the small number of measurements available so that no reliable global estimate of cloud condensation nuclei exists. This study overcomes this limitation using a self-consistent global model (ECHAM-HAM) of aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei. An analysis of the correlation of simulated aerosol radiative properties and cloud condensation nuclei reveals that common assumptions about their relationships are violated for a significant fraction of the globe: 71{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the area of the globe shows correlation coefficients between CCN$_{\textrm{0.2{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\%}}$ at cloud base and aerosol optical depth (AOD) below 0.5, i.e. AOD variability explains only 25{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}\% of the CCN variance. This has significant implications for satellite based studies of aerosol–cloud interactions.

While it is possible to retrieve aerosol properties above clouds under certain circumstances, aerosol properties are usually only retrieved in cloud-free scenes. Generally, the smaller spatial variability of aerosols compared to clouds reduces the importance of this sampling difference. However, as precipitation generates an increase in spatial variability of aerosols, the imperfect co-location of aerosol and cloud property retrievals may lead to changes in observed aerosol–cloud–precipitation relationships in precipitating environments. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} In this work, we use a regional-scale model, satellite observations and reanalysis data to investigate how the non-coincidence of aerosol, cloud and precipitation retrievals affects correlations between them. We show that the difference in the aerosol optical depth (AOD)–precipitation relationship between general circulation models (GCMs) and satellite observations can be explained by the wet scavenging of aerosol. Using observations of the development of precipitation from cloud regimes, we show how the influence of wet scavenging can obscure possible aerosol influences on precipitation from convective clouds. This obscuring of aerosol–cloud–precipitation interactions by wet scavenging suggests that even if GCMs contained a perfect representation of aerosol influences on convective clouds, the difficulty of separating the "clear-sky" aerosol from the "all-sky" aerosol in GCMs may prevent them from reproducing the correlations seen in satellite data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Accurately quantifying this relationship from space is challenging due in part to contamination of aerosol statistics near clouds. Aerosol retrievals near clouds can be influenced by stray cloud particles in areas assumed to be cloud-free, particle swelling by humidification, shadows and enhanced scattering into the aerosol field from (3-D radiative transfer) clouds. To screen for this contamination we have developed a new cloud–aerosol pairing algorithm (CAPA) to link cloud observations to the nearest aerosol retrieval within the satellite image. The distance between each aerosol retrieval and nearest cloud is also computed in CAPA. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}/br{\textgreater} Results from two independent satellite imagers, the Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), show a marked reduction in the strength of the intrinsic aerosol indirect radiative forcing when selecting aerosol pairs that are located farther away from the clouds (−0.28±0.26{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}W{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{−2}}$) compared to those including pairs that are within 15{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}km of the nearest cloud (−0.49±0.18{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}W{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m$^{\textrm{−2}}$). The larger aerosol optical depths in closer proximity to cloud artificially enhance the relationship between aerosol-loading, cloud albedo, and cloud fraction.

	abstract = {The polarization measurements achieved by the POLDER instrument on ADEOS-1 are used for the remote sensing of aerosols over land surfaces. The key advantage of using polarized observations is their ability to systematically correct for the ground contribution, whereas the classical approach using natural light fails. The estimation of land surface polarizing properties from POLDER has been examined in a previous paper. Here we consider how the optical thickness δ0 and Ångstrom exponent α of aerosols are derived from the polarized light backscattered by the particles. The inversion scheme is detailed, and illustrative results are presented. Maps of the retrieved optical thickness allow for detection of large aerosol features, and in the case of small aerosols, the δ0 and α retrievals are consistent with correlative ground-based measurements. However, because polarized light stems mainly from small particles, the results are biased for aerosol distributions containing coarser modes of particles. To overcome this limitation, an aerosol index defined as the product AI = δ0α is proposed. Theoretical analysis and comparison with ground-based measurements suggest that AI is approximately the same when using δ0, and α is related to the entire aerosol size distribution or derived from the polarized light originating from the small polarizing particles alone. This invariance is specially assessed by testing the continuity of AI across coastlines, given the unbiased properties of aerosol retrieval over ocean. Although reducing the information concerning the aerosols, this single parameter allows a link between the POLDER aerosol surveys over land and ocean. POLDER aerosol index global maps enable the monitoring of major aerosol sources over continental areas.},

As a major agent for clouds to form and a significant attenuator of solar radiation, aerosols affect climate in several ways. Current research suggests that aerosol effects on clouds could further extend to precipitation, both through the formation of cloud particles and by exerting persistent radiative forcing on the climate system that disturbs dynamics. However, the various mechanisms behind these effects, in particular, the ones connected to precipitation, are not yet well understood. The atmospheric and climate communities have long been working to gain a better grasp of these critical effects and hence to reduce the significant uncertainties in climate prediction resulting from such a lack of adequate knowledge. Here we review past efforts and summarize our current understanding of the effect of aerosols on convective precipitation processes from theoretical analysis of microphysics, observational evidence, and a range of numerical model simulations. In addition, the discrepancies between results simulated by models, as well as those between simulations and observations, are presented. Specifically, this paper addresses the following topics: (1) fundamental theories of aerosol effects on microphysics and precipitation processes, (2) observational evidence of the effect of aerosols on precipitation processes, (3) signatures of the aerosol impact on precipitation from large-scale analyses, (4) results from cloud-resolving model simulations, and (5) results from large-scale numerical model simulations. Finally, several future research directions for gaining a better understanding of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions are suggested.},

	abstract = {Life on Earth is critically dependent upon the continuous cycling of water between oceans, continents and the atmosphere. Precipitation (including rain, snow, and hail) is the primary mechanism for transporting water from the atmosphere back to the Earth’s surface. It is also the key physical process that links aspects of climate, weather, and the global hydrological cycle. Changes in precipitation regimes and the frequency of extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, severe ice/snow storms, monsoon fluctuations and hurricanes are of great potential importance to life on the planet. One of the factors that could contribute to precipitation modification is aerosol pollution from various sources such as urban air pollution and biomass burning. Natural and anthropogenic changes in atmospheric aerosols might have important implications for precipitation by influencing the hydrological cycle, which in turn could feed back to climate changes. From an Earth Science perspective, a key question is how changes expected in climate will translate into changes in the hydrological cycle, and what trends may be expected in the future. We require a much better understanding and hence predictive capability of the moisture and energy storages and exchanges among the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, continents and biological systems. This book is a review of our knowledge of the relationship between aerosols and precipitation reaching the Earth's surface and it includes a list of recommendations that could help to advance our knowledge in this area.},

	abstract = {Based on research showing that in the case of a strong aerosol forcing, this forcing establishes itself early in the historical record, a simple model is constructed to explore the implications of a strongly negative aerosol forcing on the early (pre-1950) part of the instrumental record. This model, which contains terms representing both aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions, well represents the known time history of aerosol radiative forcing as well as the effect of the natural state on the strength of aerosol forcing. Model parameters, randomly drawn to represent uncertainty in understanding, demonstrate that a forcing more negative than −1.0 W m−2 is implausible, as it implies that none of the approximately 0.3-K temperature rise between 1850 and 1950 can be attributed to Northern Hemisphere forcing. The individual terms of the model are interpreted in light of comprehensive modeling, constraints from observations, and physical understanding to provide further support for the less negative (−1.0 W m−2) lower bound. These findings suggest that aerosol radiative forcing is less negative and more certain than is commonly believed.},

	abstract = {Reflections on cloud effects
How much impact does the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols above the oceans have on global temperatures? Rosenfeld et al. analyzed how CCN affect the properties of marine stratocumulus clouds, which reflect much of the solar radiation received by Earth back to space (see the Perspective by Sato and Suzuki). The CCN abundance explained most of the variability in the radiative cooling. Thus, the magnitude of radiative forcing provided by these clouds is much more sensitive to the presence of CCN than current models indicate, which suggests the existence of other compensating warming effects.

Structured Abstract
INTRODUCTIONHuman-made emissions of particulate air pollution can offset part of the warming induced by emissions of greenhouse gases, by enhancing low-level clouds that reflect more solar radiation back to space. The aerosol particles have this effect because cloud droplets must condense on preexisting tiny particles in the same way as dew forms on cold objects; more aerosol particles from human-made emissions lead to larger numbers of smaller cloud droplets. One major pathway for low-level cloud enhancement is through the suppression of rain by reducing cloud droplet sizes. This leaves more water in the cloud for a longer time, thus increasing the cloud cover and water content and thereby reflecting more solar heat to space. This effect is strongest over the oceans, where moisture for sustaining low-level clouds over vast areas is abundant. Predicting global warming requires a quantitative understanding of how cloud cover and water content are affected by human-made aerosols.
RATIONALEQuantifying the aerosol cloud–mediated radiative effects has been a major challenge and has driven the uncertainty in climate predictions. It has been difficult to measure cloud-active aerosols from satellites and to isolate their effects on clouds from meteorological data. The development of novel methodologies to retrieve cloud droplet concentrations and vertical winds from satellites represents a breakthrough that made this quantification possible. The methodologies were applied to the world’s oceans between the equator and 40°S. Aerosol and meteorological variables explained 95\% of the variability in the cloud radiative effects.
RESULTSThe measured aerosol cloud–mediated cooling effect was much larger than the present estimates, especially via the effect of aerosols on the suppression of precipitation, which makes the clouds retain more water, persist longer, and have a larger fractional coverage. This goes against most previous observations and simulations, which reported that vertically integrated cloud water may even decrease with additional aerosols, especially in precipitating clouds. The major reason for this apparent discrepancy is because deeper clouds have more water and produce rainfall more easily, thus scavenging the aerosols more efficiently. The outcome is that clouds with fewer aerosols have more water, but it has nothing to do with aerosol effects on clouds. This fallacy is overcome when assessing the effects for clouds with a given fixed geometrical thickness.The large aerosol sensitivity of the water content and coverage of shallow marine clouds dispels another belief that the effects of added aerosols are mostly buffered by adjustment of the cloud properties, which counteracts the initial aerosol effect. For example, adding aerosols suppresses rain, so the clouds respond by deepening just enough to restore the rain amount that was suppressed. But the time scale required for the completion of this adjustment process is substantially longer than the life cycle of the cloud systems, which is mostly under 12 hours. Therefore, most of the marine shallow clouds are not buffered for the aerosol effects, which are inducing cooling to a much greater extent than previously believed.
CONCLUSIONAerosols explain three-fourths of the variability in the cooling effects of low-level marine clouds for a given geometrical thickness. Doubling the cloud droplet concentration nearly doubles the cooling. This reveals a much greater sensitivity to aerosols than previously reported, meaning too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This argument has been used to dismiss such large sensitivities. To avoid that, the aerosol effects in some of the models were tuned down. Accepting the large sensitivity revealed in this study implies that aerosols have another large positive forcing, possibly through the deep clouds, which is not accounted for in current models. This reveals additional uncertainty that must be accounted for and requires a major revision in calculating Earth’s energy budget and climate predictions. Paradoxically, this advancement in our knowledge increases the uncertainty in aerosol cloud–mediated radiative forcing. But it paves the way to eventual substantial reduction of this uncertainty. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/363/6427/eaav0566/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Coverage and droplet concentrations (Nd) of shallow marine clouds over the northeast Pacific.Smoke particles emitted from ship smokestacks form cloud droplets and elevate Nd.

The solid cloud cover is maintained by smoke that was spread from old ship tracks, crossed by newer ones.
A lack of reliable estimates of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) aerosols over oceans has severely limited our ability to quantify their effects on cloud properties and extent of cooling by reflecting solar radiation—a key uncertainty in anthropogenic climate forcing. We introduce a methodology for ascribing cloud properties to CCN and isolating the aerosol effects from meteorological effects. Its application showed that for a given meteorology, CCN explains three-fourths of the variability in the radiative cooling effect of clouds, mainly through affecting shallow cloud cover and water path. This reveals a much greater sensitivity of cloud radiative forcing to CCN than previously reported, which means too much cooling if incorporated into present climate models. This suggests the existence of compensating aerosol warming effects yet to be discovered, possibly through deep clouds.

Here we evaluate the aerosol effect on clouds, using large statistics of daily satellite data over the North Atlantic Ocean. We found a strong correlation between the presence of aerosols and the structural properties of convective clouds. These correlations suggest systematic invigoration of convective clouds by pollution, desert dust and biomass burning aerosols. On average increase in the aerosol concentration from a baseline to the average values is associated with a 0.05 ± 0.01 increase in the cloud fraction and a 40 ± 5mb decrease in the cloud top pressure.},

This study is confined to warm phase and single layer clouds without precipitation during the summertime (June, July, and August). Our analysis suggest that cloud effective radius (CER) is positively correlated with aerosol index (AI) over land (positive slopes), but negatively correlated over oceans (negative slopes) even with small ranges of liquid water path (quasi-constant). The changes in albedo at the top of atmosphere (TOA) corresponding to aerosol-induced changes in CER also lends credence to the authenticity of this opposite aerosol-cloud correlation between land and ocean. It is noted that potential artifacts, such as the retrieval biases of both cloud (partially cloudy and 3-D shaped clouds) and aerosol, can result in a serious overestimation of the slope of CER-AI. Our results show that collision-coalescence seems not to be the dominant cause for positive slope over land, but the increased CER caused by increased aerosol might further increase CER by initializing collision-coalescence, generating a positive feedback. By stratifying data according to the lower tropospheric stability and relative humidity near cloud top, it is found that the positive correlations more likely occur in case of drier cloud top and stronger turbulence in clouds, while negative correlations occur in case of moister cloud top and weaker turbulence in clouds, which implies entrainment mixing might be a possible physical interpretation for such a positive CER-AI slope.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Some of the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases is offset by increased reflection of solar radiation by clouds with smaller droplets that form in air polluted with aerosol particles that serve as cloud condensation nuclei1. The resulting cooling tendency, termed the indirect aerosol forcing, is thought to be comparable in magnitude to the forcing by anthropogenic CO2, but it is difficult to estimate because the physical processes that determine global aerosol and cloud populations are poorly understood2. Smaller cloud droplets not only reflect sunlight more effectively, but also inhibit precipitation, which is expected to result in increased cloud water3,4. Such an increase in cloud water would result in even more reflective clouds, further increasing the indirect forcing. Marine boundary-layer clouds polluted by aerosol particles, however, are not generally observed to hold more water5,6,7. Here we simulate stratocumulus clouds with a fluid dynamics model that includes detailed treatments of cloud microphysics and radiative transfer. Our simulations show that the response of cloud water to suppression of precipitation from increased droplet concentrations is determined by a competition between moistening from decreased surface precipitation and drying from increased entrainment of overlying air. Only when the overlying air is humid or droplet concentrations are very low does sufficient precipitation reach the surface to allow cloud water to increase with droplet concentrations. Otherwise, the response of cloud water to aerosol-induced suppression of precipitation is dominated by enhanced entrainment of overlying dry air. In this scenario, cloud water is reduced as droplet concentrations increase, which diminishes the indirect climate forcing.},

While there is a rich history of observational work on convective clustering and organization, there have been only a few studies that have analyzed observations to look specifically for processes related to self-aggregation in models. Here we review observational work in both of these categories and motivate the need for more of this work. We acknowledge that self-aggregation may appear to be far-removed from observed convective organization in terms of time scales, initial conditions, initiation processes, and mean state extremes, but we argue that these differences vary greatly across the diverse range of model simulations in the literature and that these comparisons are already offering important insights into real tropical phenomena. Some preliminary new findings are presented, including results showing that a self-aggregation simulation with square geometry has too broad distribution of humidity and is too dry in the driest regions when compared with radiosonde records from Nauru, while an elongated channel simulation has realistic representations of atmospheric humidity and its variability. We discuss recent work increasing our understanding of how organized convection and climate change may interact, and how model discrepancies related to this question are prompting interest in observational comparisons. We also propose possible future directions for observational work related to convective aggregation, including novel satellite approaches and a ground-based observational network.},

	abstract = {It was once generally thought that stratiform precipitation was something occurring primarily, if not exclusively, in middle latitudes—in baroclinic cyclones and fronts. Early radar observations in the Tropics, however, showed large radar echoes composed of convective rain alongside stratiform precipitation, with the stratiform echoes covering great areas and accounting for a large portion of the tropical rainfall. These observations seemed paradoxical, since stratiform precipitation should not have been occurring in the Tropics, where baroclinic cyclones do not occur. Instead it was falling from convection-generated clouds, generally thought to be too violent to be compatible with the layered, gently settling behavior of stratiform precipitation. In meteorology, convection is a dynamic concept; specifically, it is the rapid, efficient, vigorous overturning of the atmosphere required to neutralize an unstable vertical distribution of moist static energy. Most clouds in the Tropics are convection-generated cumulonimbus. These cumulonimbus clouds contain an evolving pattern of newer and older precipitation. The young portions of the cumulonimbus are too violent to produce stratiform precipitation. In young, vigorous convective regions of the cumulonimbus, precipitation particles increase their mass by collection of cloud water, and the particles fall out in heavy showers, which appear on radar as vertically oriented convective “cells.” In regions of older convection, however, the vertical air motions are generally weaker, and the precipitation particles drift downward, with the particles increasing their mass by vapor diffusion. In these regions the radar echoes are stratiform, and typically these echoes occur adjacent to regions of younger convective showers. Thus, the stratiform and convective precipitation both occur within the same complex of convection-generated cumulonimbus cloud. The feedbacks of the apparent heat source and moisture sink of tropical cumulonimbus convection to the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere are distinctly separable by precipitation region. The part of the atmospheric response deriving from the areas of young, vigorous convective cells is two layered, with air converging into the active convection at low levels and diverging aloft. The older, weaker intermediary and stratiform precipitation areas induce a three-layered response, in which environmental air converges into the weak precipitation area at midlevels and diverges from it at lower and upper levels. If global precipitation data, such as that to be provided by the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, are to be used to validate the heating patterns predicted by climate and general circulation models, algorithms must be applied to the precipitation data that will identify the two principal modes of heating, by separating the convective component of the precipitation from the remainder.},

	abstract = {The impact of giant and ultragiant cloud condensation nuclei ({\textgreater}5-μm radius) on drizzle formation in stratocumuli is investigated within a number of modeling frameworks. These include a simple box model of collection, a trajectory ensemble model (comprising an ensemble of Lagrangian parcel models), a 2D eddy-resolving model, and a 3D large-eddy simulation model. Observed concentrations of giant cloud condensation nuclei (GCCN) over the ocean at ambient conditions indicate that 20-μm radius haze particles exist in concentrations of between 10−4 and 10−2 cm−3, depending on ambient wind speed and seastate. It is shown that these concentrations are sufficient to move a nonprecipitating stratocumulus into a precipitating state at typical cloud condensation nucleus (CCN) concentrations of 50 to 250 cm−3, with higher concentrations of GCCN being required at higher CCN concentrations. However, at lower CCN concentrations, drizzle is often active anyway and the addition of GCCN has little impact. At high CCN concentrations, drizzle development is slow and GCCN have the greatest potential for enhancing the collection process. Thus, although drizzle production decreases with increasing CCN concentration, the relative impact of GCCN increases with increasing CCN concentration. It is also shown that in the absence of GCCN, a shift in the modal radius of the CCN distribution to larger sizes suppresses drizzle because larger modal radii enable the activation of larger droplet number concentrations. Finally, calculations of the impact of GCCN on cloud optical properties are performed over a range of parameter space. Results indicate that the presence of GCCN moderates the effect of CCN on optical properties quite significantly. In the absence of GCCN, an increase in CCN from 50 to 150 cm−3 results in a threefold increase in albedo; when GCCN exist at a concentration of 10−3 cm−3, the increase in albedo is only twofold. Thus the variable presence of GCCN represents yet another uncertainty in estimating the influence of anthropogenic activity on climate.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cirrus outflow from deep convection are analyzed as dynamically and thermodynamically active systems. The initial outflow is considered as an analog to wake collapse, in which a neutrally buoyant flow intrusion is flattened and stretched by its stratified environment, and the initially isotropic turbulence within it is converted to other forms. The early spread of the outflow is predicted on the basis of analytic and numerical calculations by Dugan et al. Strong radiative heat flux curvature then leads to maintenance or regeneration of buoyant turbulence in the collapsed outflow plume. Mixed layer analysis allow predictions of entrainment rates. In the case of strong net radiative heating, the mixed layer model predicts an encroachment condition, in which the upper boundary attains nearly the same temperature as the environment and grows into it rapidly. This tendency is countered by bodily ascent of the warm mesoscale plumes, the rate of which is predicted with the aid of a theory of drag on a flat plate in a stratified fluid. It is found that narrow plumes rise rapidly enough that their mean temperature is not much different from the environment, and their tops may be cold enough to contribute to drying of the lower stratosphere. Wider plumes follow the mixed layer analysis and develop a substantial temperature excess and an encroaching upper boundary condition. The critical width is estimated to be of order 150 km. The effect of cirrus precipitation represents an unknown limitation to this analysis.},

Small changes in the amount of cloud coverage can produce a climate forcing equivalent in magnitude and opposite in sign to that caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and changes in cloud height can shift the effect of clouds from cooling to warming. Focusing on the Amazon, we show a smooth transition between two opposing effects of aerosols on clouds: the microphysical and the radiative. We show how a feedback between the optical properties of aerosols and the cloud fraction can modify the aerosol forcing, changing the total radiative energy and redistributing it over the atmospheric column.
Modeling and satellite data show how absorption of light by aerosols can affect cloud properties and growth, linking these particles' opposing radiative and physical effects.

	abstract = {Deep convective clouds (DCCs) play a crucial role in the general circulation, energy, and hydrological cycle of our climate system. Aerosol particles can influence DCCs by altering cloud properties, precipitation regimes, and radiation balance. Previous studies reported both invigoration and suppression of DCCs by aerosols, but few were concerned with the whole life cycle of DCC. By conducting multiple monthlong cloud-resolving simulations with spectral-bin cloud microphysics that capture the observed macrophysical and microphysical properties of summer convective clouds and precipitation in the tropics and midlatitudes, this study provides a comprehensive view of how aerosols affect cloud cover, cloud top height, and radiative forcing. We found that although the widely accepted theory of DCC invigoration due to aerosol’s thermodynamic effect (additional latent heat release from freezing of greater amount of cloud water) may work during the growing stage, it is microphysical effect influenced by aerosols that drives the dramatic increase in cloud cover, cloud top height, and cloud thickness at the mature and dissipation stages by inducing larger amounts of smaller but longer-lasting ice particles in the stratiform/anvils of DCCs, even when thermodynamic invigoration of convection is absent. The thermodynamic invigoration effect contributes up to ∼27\% of total increase in cloud cover. The overall aerosol indirect effect is an atmospheric radiative warming (3–5 W⋅m−2) and a surface cooling (−5 to −8 W⋅m−2). The modeling findings are confirmed by the analyses of ample measurements made at three sites of distinctly different environments.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, the number of studies that investigate aerosol–cloud interactions has increased considerably. Although tremendous progress has been made to improve the understanding of basic physical mechanisms of aerosol–cloud interactions and reduce their uncertainties in climate forcing, there is still poor understanding of 1) some of the mechanisms that interact with each other over multiple spatial and temporal scales, 2) the feedbacks between microphysical and dynamical processes and between local-scale processes and large-scale circulations, and 3) the significance of cloud–aerosol interactions on weather systems as well as regional and global climate. This review focuses on recent theoretical studies and important mechanisms on aerosol–cloud interactions and discusses the significances of aerosol impacts on radiative forcing and precipitation extremes associated with different cloud systems. The authors summarize the main obstacles preventing the science from making a leap—for example, the lack of concurrent profile measurements of cloud dynamics, microphysics, and aerosols over a wide region on the observation side and the large variability of cloud microphysics parameterizations resulting in a large spread of modeling results on the modeling side. Therefore, large efforts are needed to escalate understanding. Future directions should focus on obtaining concurrent measurements of aerosol properties and cloud microphysical and dynamic properties over a range of temporal and spatial scales collected over typical climate regimes and closure studies, as well as improving understanding and parameterizations of cloud microphysics such as ice nucleation, mixed-phase properties, and hydrometeor size and fall speed.},

We present an original high-resolution (4 km, hourly) unified data product of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and isolated deep convection (IDC) in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains and examine their climatological characteristics from 2004 to 2017. The data product is produced by applying an updated Flexible Object Tracker algorithm to hourly satellite brightness temperature, radar reflectivity, and precipitation datasets. Analysis of the data product shows that MCSs are much larger and longer-lasting than IDC, but IDC occurs about 100 times more frequently than MCSs, with a mean convective intensity comparable to that of MCSs. Hence both MCS and IDC are essential contributors to precipitation east of the Rocky Mountains, although their precipitation shows significantly different spatiotemporal characteristics. IDC precipitation concentrates in summer in the Southeast with a peak in the late afternoon, while MCS precipitation is significant in all seasons, especially for spring and summer in the Great Plains. The spatial distribution of MCS precipitation amounts varies by season, while diurnally, MCS precipitation generally peaks during nighttime except in the Southeast. Potential uncertainties and limitations of the data product are also discussed. The data product is useful for investigating the atmospheric environments and physical processes associated with different types of convective systems; quantifying the impacts of convection on hydrology, atmospheric chemistry, and severe weather events; and evaluating and improving the representation of convective processes in weather and climate models.

	abstract = {Sea breeze fronts propagate inland from the coastline, driving convective initiation and aerosol redistribution. Forecasting sea breezes is challenging due to uncertainties in the initial conditions, as well as the covariance and interaction of various meteorological and surface parameters. Using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System coupled to an interactive land-surface model, we conduct an ensemble of 130 idealized cloud-resolving simulations by simultaneously perturbing six atmospheric and four surface parameters describing the initial conditions. To identify the key parameters impacting the inland characteristics and the intensity of the sea breeze convection in a tropical rainforest, we apply statistical emulation and variance-based sensitivity analysis techniques. This study extends a previous study which explored the impacts of various parameters on sea breeze characteristics in arid environments devoid of moist convection. Wind speed is identified as the main contributor to the inland extent, similar to the arid environment study. However, the relative impacts of surface properties on the inland extent are less significant in the moist environment where land-surface heating can be suppressed via moist convective processes and vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Two sea breeze-initiated convection regimes are also identified: shallow and deep. Over the shallow regime, where convective available potential energy is limited, the inversion layer strength is the primary control of the convective intensity. Over the deep regime, boundary layer temperature exerts a robust control over the convective available potential energy and hence the convective intensity. The potential vertical redistribution of aerosols is closely related to the convective intensity.},

In contrast, a microwave method based on the brightness temperature differences between the three water vapor channels around 183.3 GHz of the Advanced Microwave Sounder Unit (AMSU)-B (183.3 ± 1, 183.3 ± 3, and 183.3 ± 7 GHz) can screen out high thick cirrus clouds efﬁciently. The tropical deep convective cloud fractions (30◦ S–30◦ N) estimated by the IR methods and the AMSU-B method are compared. Although their geographical distributions are in well agreement with each other, the total fractions detected by the IR methods are about 2 to 3.5 times greater than that detected by the AMSU-B method. Moreover, the overestimation of deep convective cloud fractions by the IR method (11 µm brightness temperature less than 215 K) can result in a displacement in the detected location of the deep convective clouds. The average thick cirrus clouds cover 2.5 times the area of the deep convective clouds that generates them.},

We utilise an optical flow method to determine the motion of deep convective clouds in GOES-16 ABI imagery in order to construct a semi-Lagrangian framework for the motion of the cloud field, independently of the detection and tracking of cloud objects. The semi-Lagrangian framework allows for severe storms to be simultaneously detected and tracked in both spatial and temporal dimensions. For the purpose of this framework we have developed a novel Lagrangian convolution method and a number of novel implementations of morphological image operations that account for the motion of observed objects. These novel methods allow the accurate extension of computer vision techniques to the temporal domain for moving objects such as DCCs. By combining this framework with existing methods for detecting deep convective clouds (including detection of growing cores through cloud top cooling and detection of anvil using brightness temperature), we show that the novel framework enables reductions in errors due to both false and missed detections compared to any of the individual methods, reducing the need to compromise when compared with existing frameworks. The novel framework enables the continuous tracking of anvil clouds associated with detected deep convection after convective activity has stopped, enabling the study of the entire lifecycle of deep convective clouds and their associated anvils. Furthermore, we expect this framework to applicable to a wide range of cases including the detection and tracking of low-level clouds and other atmospheric phenomena. In addition, this framework may be used to combine observations from multiple sources, including satellite observations, weather radar and reanalysis model data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Precipitation estimates from satellite infrared (IR) radiometers are typically based on cloud top temperatures. However, these temperatures are weakly related to surface rainfall, particularly for shallow or warm clouds. This study classifies precipitating clouds into five cloud groups. The classification uses three brightness temperature differences (BTDs) and one BTD difference (ΔBTD) from Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI): BTD1 (6.2–11.2 µm), BTD2 (8.6–11.2 µm), BTD3 (11.2–12.4 µm), and ΔBTD (BTD2 − BTD3). BTD1 is found to be effective for separating shallow and non-shallow clouds in reference to the Global Precipitation Measurement Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) level 2 data. Once this separation is complete, non-shallow clouds are further classified. The negative and positive values of ΔBTD usually indicate more water and more ice in clouds, respectively, distinguishing non-shallow clouds with tall and taller cloud heights. Subsequently, BTD1 is applied to non-shallow-tall/taller clouds. Because these clouds can be considered as optically thick, BTD1 identifies the relative coldness of the cloud top based on the extent of water vapour over the cloud top. The final classification yields four non-shallow cloud types: non-shallow-tall-cold, non-shallow-tall-colder, non-shallow-taller-cold, and non-shallow-taller-colder clouds. The relationships between IR brightness temperatures and surface rainfall obtained from the classified cloud groups over four latitude bands reveal clear differences, implying that separating cloud types and accounting for regional differences are desirable to improve the accuracy of IR-based precipitation measurements.},

It excels at clustering simple flashes but experiences anomalies with complex flashes that last longer than 3 s or contain more than 100 groups, leading to flashes being artificially split. We develop a technique that corrects these anomalies and apply it to the 2018 GLM data to document all lightning across the Americas. We produce statistics describing the characteristics and frequencies of reclustered GLM flashes and thunderstorm area features. The average GLM Americas flash rate in 2018 was 11.7 flashes per second with the greatest flash rate densities occurring over Lake Maracaibo (157 flashes per km2/year). Lloró, Chocó, Colombia had the most thunderstorm activity with 256 thunder days. The longest GLM flash spanned 673 km, the largest flash covered 114,997 km2, and the longest-lasting flash had a 13.496-s duration. The first case occurred over Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil, while the other two cases occurred in the central United States. All three extreme flashes are located in the stratiform regions of Mesoscale Convective Systems. The highest flash rate for a thunderstorm area feature was 17.6 flashes per second, while the largest thunderstorm was 216,865 km2 in size. Both storms occurred in South America. These initial results demonstrate the value that the development of a reprocessed GLM science product would offer and how such a product might be created at a reduced computational cost., NOAA’s newest geostationary weather satellites (GOES-16 and GOES-17) are the first to feature lightning detectors. These sensors are known as Geostationary Lightning Mappers (GLMs) and use the flash of light illuminating the cloud during a lightning discharge to detect it and determine where it occurred. GLM uses specialized algorithms to identify individual lightning flashes. These algorithms only have 5 s to find all of the flashes that occurred across North and South America and can easily get bogged down by the tremendous amount of GLM data coming down from the satellite. To overcome this, the algorithms quit when flashes become too complex, and this results in single natural lightning flashes being artificially split into multiple degraded flashes. We develop a technique for fixing this splitting problem and apply it to all of the 2018 GLM data. This new data set allows us to examine all types of lightning, not just simple flashes. We use this corrected data to show how often lightning and thunderstorms occur, to document what flashes look like, and to identify extreme examples of lightning across the Americas.},

	abstract = {The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite R-series (GOES-R) is the next block of four satellites to follow the existing GOES constellation currently operating over the Western Hemisphere. Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8km with a product refresh rate of less than 20s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings.},

	abstract = {The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) is a space-based instrument specifically designed to detect and locate lightning discharges as it orbits the Earth. This instrument is a scientific payload on the MicroLab-1 satellite that was launched into a 70° inclination low Earth orbit in April 1995. Given the orbital trajectory of the satellite, most regions of the Earth are observed by the OTD instrument more than 400 times during a 1 year period, and the average duration of each observation is 2 min. The OTD instrument optically detects lightning flashes that occur within its 1300 × 1300 km2 field of view during both day and night conditions. A statistical examination of OTD lightning data reveals that nearly 1.4 billion flashes occur annually over the entire Earth. This annual flash count translates to an average of 44 ± 5 lightning flashes (intracloud and cloud-to-ground combined) occurring around the globe every second, which is well below the traditional estimate of 100 fl s−1 that was derived in 1925 from world thunder day records. The range of uncertainty for the OTD global totals represents primarily the uncertainty (and variability) in the flash detection efficiency of the instrument. The OTD measurements have been used to construct lightning climatology maps that demonstrate the geographical and seasonal distribution of lightning activity for the globe. An analysis of this annual lightning distribution confirms that lightning occurs mainly over land areas, with an average land/ocean ratio of ∼10:1. The Congo basin, which stands out year-round, shows a peak mean annual flash density of 80 fl km−2 yr−1 in Rwanda, and includes an area of over 3 million km2 exhibiting flash densities greater than 30 fl km−2 yr−1 (the flash density of central Florida). Lightning is predominant in the northern Atlantic and western Pacific Ocean basins year-round where instability is produced from cold air passing over warm ocean water. Lightning is less frequent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean basins where the air mass is warmer. A dominant Northern Hemisphere summer peak occurs in the annual cycle, and evidence is found for a tropically driven semiannual cycle.},

Two detectors, one operating in the 375–695 nm region and one in the 650–880 nm region, recorded emissions from the same lightning. Ten flashes containing 46 recorded strokes were selected for detailed analysis from 500 flashes recorded in 1981. Thew ten flashes occurred within three degrees of the optical axis of the spectrometer system. The average stroke spectral irradiance from 375 to 650 nm for flashes at approximately 15 km is 3.5 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke with a standard deviation of 2.0 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ and a range from 0.7 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ to 6.8 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke. The average stroke spectral irradiance from 650 to 880 nm for the same strokes is 1.2 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ j m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke with a standard deviation of 0.7 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ and a range from 0.5 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ to 3.2 × 10$^{\textrm{−5}}$ J m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ per stroke. The ratio of the visible to infrared spectral irradiance for the previously specified wavelength ranges, 375–650 and 650–880 nm, is 3.

A summary table of spectral irradiance values in 50 nm increments is presented. The strongest emissions in 50 nm increments occur in the visible region centered at 505 nm. These emissions are over four times greater than at a similar 50 nm increment centered at 825 nm.

Because the split-window method provides cloud properties that are consistent for day and night, it is ideally suited for the generation of a cloud climatology from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which provides sampling roughly four times per day. While the split-window approach is applicable to all clouds, this paper focuses on its application to cirrus (high semitransparent ice clouds), where this approach is most powerful. An optimal estimation framework is used to extract estimates of cloud temperature, cloud emissivity, and cloud microphysics from the AVHRR split-window observations. The performance of the split-window approach is illustrated through the diagnostic quantities generated by the optimal estimation approach. An objective assessment of the performance of the algorithm cloud products from the recently launched space lidar [Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation/Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO/CALIOP)] is used to characterize the performance of the AVHRR results and also to provide the constraints needed for the optimal estimation approach.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

These filters differ in their complexity and intended use. We use the most appropriate filters to document the severity of GLM solar contamination and to compute the frequency of extreme Americas lightning. Solar artifacts occur at an average rate of one every {\textasciitilde}8 min. Due to their continuous emissions across a portion of the GLM CCD array, these events disproportionately contribute to the GLM event and group rates. Up to 40\% of all events recorded between 10:00 and 12:00 local time during 2018 were solar artifacts. The frequency-domain solar filter also reveals a carrier wave at 50 to 60 Hz in some lightning flashes and solar episodes that appears to be anthropogenic in origin. Removing the relatively frequent solar artifact cases reveals rare cases of extreme lightning flashes. Exceptional flashes on the order of 500+ km in length and 10+ s in duration only occur a few times per year and are produced by storms that are predisposed for exceptional lightning rather than as single random occurrences.},

	abstract = {Global atmospheric heat exchanges are highly dependent on the variation of cloud types and amounts. For a better understanding of these exchanges, an appropriate cloud type classification method is necessary. The present study proposes an alternative approach to the often used cloud optical and thermodynamic properties based classifications. This approach relies on the application of edge detection techniques on cloud top temperature (CTT) derived from global satellite maps. The gradient map obtained through these techniques is then used to distinguish various types of clouds. The edge detection techniques used are based on the idea that a pixel’s neighborhood contains information about its intensity. The variation of this intensity (gradient) offers the possibility to decompose the image into different cloud morphological features. High gradient areas would correspond to cumulus-like clouds, while low gradient areas would be associated with stratus-like clouds. Following the application of these principles, the results of the cloud classification obtained are evaluated against a common cloud classification method based on cloud optical properties’ variations. Relatively good matches between the two approaches are obtained. The best results are observed with high gradient clouds and the worst with low gradient clouds.},

This study is motivated by National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster reviews of the algorithm output, which hypothesized that more intense cloud-top cooling corresponds to more vigorous short-term (0–60 min) convective development. An objective validation of UW-CTC rates using a satellite-based object-tracking methodology is presented, along with a prognostic evaluation of such cloud-top cooling rates for use in forecasting the growth and development of deep convection. In general, both a cloud object’s instantaneous and maximum cooling rate(s) are shown to be useful prognostic tools in predicting future radar intensification. UW-CTC rates are shown to be most skillful in detecting convective clouds that achieved intense radar signatures. The UW-CTC rate lead time ahead of the various radar fields is also shown, along with an illustration of the benefit of UW-CTC rates in operational forecasting. The results of this study suggest that convective clouds with the strongest UW-CTC rates are more likely to achieve significant near-term (0–60 min) radar signatures in such fields as composite reflectivity, vertically integrated liquid (VIL), and maximum estimated size of hail (MESH) compared to clouds that exhibit only weak UW-CTC rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Its distinctive feature is the assignment of alternate labels to sites belonging to the same cluster. These sites are members of a simulated finite random lattice. An algorithm useful for the determination of the critical percolation concentration of a finite lattice is also presented. This algorithm is especially useful when applied in conjunction with the cluster multiple labeling technique. The basic features of this technique are illustrated by applying it to a small planar square lattice. Numerical results are given for a triangular subcrystal containing up to 9 000 000 sites.

We test the DCNN in four experiments: small scale binary and multi-class sentiment prediction, six-way question classification and Twitter sentiment prediction by distant supervision.

	abstract = {This study is motivated by the great importance of Cbs for aviation safety. The study investigates the role of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) filtering for the remote sensing of Cumulonimbus Clouds (Cbs) by implementation of about 30 different experiments, covering Central Europe. These experiments compile different stability filter settings as well as the use of different channels for the InfraRed (IR) brightness temperatures (BT). As stability filters, parameters from Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are used. The application of the stability filters restricts the detection of Cbs to regions with a labile atmosphere. Various NWP filter settings are investigated in the experiments. The brightness temperature information results from the infrared (IR) Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Image (SEVIRI) instrument on-board of the Meteosat Second Generation satellite and enables the detection of very cold and high clouds close to the tropopause. Various satellite channels and BT thresholds are applied in the different experiments. The satellite only approaches (no NWP filtering) result in the detection of Cbs with a relative high probability of detection, but unfortunately combined with a large False Alarm Rate (FAR), leading to a Critical Success Index (CSI) below 60\% for the investigated summer period in 2016. The false alarms result from other types of very cold and high clouds. It is shown that the false alarms can be significantly decreased by application of an appropriate NWP stability filter, leading to the increase of CSI to about 70\% for 2016. CSI is increased from about 70 to about 75\% by application of NWP filtering for the other investigated summer period in 2017. A brief review and reflection of the literature clarify that the function of the NWP filter can not be replaced by MSG IR spectroscopy. Thus, NWP filtering is strongly recommended to increase the quality of satellite based Cb detection. Further, it has been shown that the well established convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the convection index (KO) work well as a stability filter.},

There will be several methods for users to acquire GOES-R imagery and products depending on their needs. These include direct reception of the imagery via the satellite downlink and an online-accessible archive.

In the past, several automatic tracking algorithms have been elaborated to tackle this problem. However, these techniques suffer from limitations in describing convection at the “true” scale and in depicting coherent MCS life cycles (split and merge artifacts). To overcome these issues, a new algorithm called Tracking Of Organized Convection Algorithm through a 3-D segmentatioN has been developed and is presented in this paper. This method operates in a time sequence of infrared images to identify and track MCS and is based on an iterative process of 3-D segmentation of the volume of infrared images. The objective of the new tracking algorithm is to associate the convective core of an MCS to its anvil cloud in the spatiotemporal domain. The technique is applied on various case studies over West Africa, Bay of Bengal, and South America. The efficiency of the new algorithm is established from an analysis of the case studies and via a statistical analysis showing that the cold cloud shield defined by a 235-K threshold in the spatiotemporal domain is decomposed into realistic MCSs. In comparison with an overlap-based tracking algorithm, the analysis reveals that MCSs are detected earlier in life cycle and later in their dissipation stages. Moreover, MCSs identified are not anymore affected by split and merge events along their life cycles, allowing a better characterization of their morphological parameters along their life cycles.},

	abstract = {We are proposing a statistical technique to analyze the best fit of the histogram of infrared brightness temperature of convective cloud pixels. For this we have utilized the infrared brightness temperatures (IRTB) of Kalpana-1 (8 km resolution) and globally merged infrared brightness temperatures of Climate Prediction Centre NCEP/NWS (4 km resolution, merged from all the available geostationary satellites GOES-8/10, METEOSAT-7/5 and GMS), for both deep convective and non-deep convective (shallow cloud) cases. It is observed that Johnson SB function is the best continuous distribution function in explaining the histogram of infrared brightness temperatures of the convective clouds. The best fit is confirmed by Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic. Johnson SB’s distribution of histogram of infrared brightness temperatures clearly discriminates the cloud pixels of deep convective and non-deep convective cases. It also captures the asymmetric nature in histogram of infrared brightness temperatures. We also observed that Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures for deep convective systems is different in each of the pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. And Johnson SB parameters are observed to be best in discriminating the Johnson SB distribution of infrared brightness temperatures of deep convective systems for each season. Due to these properties of Johnson SB function, it can be utilized in the modelling of the histogram of infrared brightness temperature of deep convective and non-deep convective systems. It focuses a new perspective on the infrared brightness temperature that will be helpful in cloud detection, classification and modelling.},

Datasets from geostationary satellite instruments such as the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) provide high-time-resolution observations across a large area.

Quantifying the diurnal cycle over the tropics and regions of desert is more difficult, as retrieval biases are larger and display significant diurnal variability. CLAAS-2 cloud top temperature data are found to be of limited skill in measuring the diurnal cycle accurately over desert regions. In tropical regions such as central Africa, the diurnal cycle can be described by the CLAAS-2 data to some extent, although retrieval biases appear to reduce the amplitude of the real diurnal cycle of cloud top temperatures. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} This is the first study to relate the diurnal variations in SEVIRI retrieval bias to observed diurnal cycles in cloud top temperature.

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) are important to the water and energy budget of the tropical climate and are essential ingredients of the tropical circulation. MCSs are readily observed in satellite infrared geostationary imagery as cloud clusters that evolve in time from small structures to well-organized large patches of cloud shield before dissipating. The MCS cloud shield is the result of a large ensemble of mesoscale dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical processes. This study shows that a simple parametric model can summarize the time evolution of the morphological characteristics of the cloud shield during the life cycle of the MCS. It consists of a growth–decay linear model of the cloud shield and is based on three parameters: the time of maximum extent, the maximum extent, and the duration of the MCS. It is shown that the time of maximum is frequently close to the middle of the life cycle and that the correlation between maximum extent and duration is strong all over the tropics. This suggests that 1 degree of freedom is left to summarize the life cycle of the MCS cloud shield. Such a model fits the observed MCS equally well, independent of the duration, size, location, and propagation characteristics, and its relevance is assessed for a large number of MCSs over three boreal summer periods over the whole tropical belt. The scaling of this simple model exhibits weak (strong) regional variability for the short- (long-) lived systems indicative of the primary importance of the internal dynamics of the systems to the large-scale environment for MCS sustainability.},

This paper presents a new objective infrared-only satellite OT detection method called infrared window (IRW)-texture. This method uses a combination of 1) infrared window channel brightness temperature (BT) gradients, 2) an NWP tropopause temperature forecast, and 3) OT size and BT criteria defined through analysis of 450 thunderstorm events within 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) imagery. Qualitative validation of the IRW-texture and the well-documented water vapor (WV) minus IRW BT difference (BTD) technique is performed using visible channel imagery, CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar, and/or Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) cloud-top height for selected cases. Quantitative validation of these two techniques is obtained though comparison with OT detections from synthetic satellite imagery derived from a cloud-resolving NWP simulation. The results show that the IRW-texture method false-alarm rate ranges from 4.2\% to 38.8\%, depending upon the magnitude of the overshooting and algorithm quality control settings. The results also show that this method offers a significant improvement over the WV-IRW BTD technique.

Calibration errors, cloud microphysics and the effect of the Planck function over horizontally inhomogeneous areas cannot explain the observation. Simulations with a line-by-line radiative transfer model show that the larger brightness temperatures in the WV absorption band are due to stratospheric water vapour, which absorbs radiation from the cold cloud top and emits radiation at higher stratospheric temperatures. The brightness temperature difference depends on the amount of water vapour and on the temperature lapse rate in the stratosphere. The temperature difference is largest when the cloud top is at the tropopause temperature inversion. The tropopause temperature in regions of deep convective clouds can be estimated from the brightness temperature differences observed in consecutive images from geostationary satellites. The method also has the potential for monitoring areas of troposphere-stratosphere exchange.},

Thresholds for the brightness temperature differences between the three channels are suggested as criterion to detect deep convective clouds, and an order relation between the differences is used to detect convective overshooting. The procedure is based on an investigation of the influence of deep convective cloud systems on the microwave brightness temperatures at frequencies from 89 to 220 GHz using simultaneous aircraft microwave and radar measurements over two tropical deep convective cloud systems, taken during the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) campaign. Two other aircraft cases with deep convective cloud systems observed during the Third Convection and Moisture Experiment (CAMEX-3) are used to validate the criteria. Furthermore, a microwave radiative transfer model and simulated mature tropical squall line data derived from the Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model are used to validate the procedures and to adapt the criteria to the varying viewing angle of AMSU-B. These methods are employed to investigate the distributions of deep convective clouds and convective overshooting in the tropics (30°S to 30°N) for the four 3-month seasons from March 2003 to February 2004 using the AMSU-B data from NOAA-15, -16, and -17. The distributions show a seasonal variability of shifting from the winter hemisphere to the summer hemisphere. The distributions of deep convective clouds follow the seasonal patterns of the surface rainfall rates. The deep convective clouds over land penetrate more frequently into the tropical tropopause layer than those over ocean. The averaged deep convective cloud fraction is about 0.3\% in the tropics, and convective overshooting contributes about 26\% to this.},

We investigate regions of distinct temporal evolution and of largest frequency of occurrence of deep convection (hereinafter referred to as convective activity), and we define and identify the deep convective stage from space observations. The analysis is based on hourly, half-hourly, and quarter-hourly brightness temperature (BT) observations of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board Meteosat 8. Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches are utilized. In the Eulerian approach, diurnal cycles and spatial distributions of BTs are calculated as averages on a local solar time (LST) and pixel basis. In the Lagrangian approach we use a stand-alone algorithm that tracks deep convective systems. Deep convection is frequently found over mountainous regions and exhibits a distinct diurnal cycle over large lakes. Local maxima of convective activity and origin of tracked systems are observed over the ocean off the west coast of Africa early in the morning. Over land the diurnal cycle of deep convective systems starts with strong rates of BT change in the formative stage, continues with the minimum BT around 1530 LST (start of the mature stage), and reaches the maximum cold cloud cover at 1730 LST (end of mature stage). The maximum number of split events marks the center of the dissipation stage at ∼1930 LST. A time shift of 1–2 h to earlier times is found in December. The life cycle analysis perfectly complements the diurnal cycle analysis and reveals characteristics of deep convective systems around the time of minimum BT10.8. Extreme rates of BT change and area expansion rates successively increase with decreasing temporal resolution. Thus quarter-hourly measurements are needed to observe the most vigorous updraft and downdraft events.},

A realistic representation of the tropical dynamics demands a simulation framework that is capable of representing physical processes across a wide range of scales. Therefore, storm-resolving numerical simulations at 2.4 km have been performed covering the tropical Atlantic and neighboring parts for 2 months. The simulated cloud fields are combined with infrared geostationary satellite observations, and their realism is assessed with the help of object-based evaluation methods. It is shown that the simulations are able to develop a well-defined intertropical convergence zone. However, marine convective activity measured by the cold cloud coverage is considerably underestimated, especially for the winter season and the western Atlantic. The spatial coupling across the resolved scales leads to simulated cloud number size distributions that follow power laws similar to the observations, with slopes steeper in winter than summer and slopes steeper over ocean than over land. The simulated slopes are, however, too steep, indicating too many small and too few large tropical cloud cells. It is also discussed that the number of larger cells is less influenced by multiday variability of environmental conditions. Despite the identified deficits, the analyzed simulations highlight the great potential of this modeling framework for process-based studies of tropical deep convection.},

A consistent temporal evolution starting with peak IC activity changing to predominant CG activity and concluding with strong outflow (microburst) suggests that ice is responsible for both the electrical (i.e., lightning) and dynamical (i.e., microburst) phenomena. The IC activity is attributed to the updraft-driven accumulation of graupel particles in the central dipole region, and the subsequent CG activity to the descent of ice particles beneath the height of the main negative charge. The subsequent descent and melting of ice particles beneath the height of the 0°C isotherm are associated with the acceleration of the downdraft and outflow. The IC lightning precursor can provide a valuable short-term (5–10 min) warning for microburst hazard at ground level.},

Ground-based Doppler and dual polarimetric radar observations were used to compute updraft characteristics. Also, ground-based total lightning data were available at both locations. Results show that time series of updraft volume in the charging zone (at temperatures colder than −5°C) with vertical velocities greater than either 5 or 10 m s−1 have clear relationships with total lightning activity (r = 0.93). Furthermore, these relationships between updraft volume and lightning activity for the storm types of the two climate regimes tend to converge when considering only the subfreezing layers of the clouds. Neither the maximum nor the mean updraft speed correlate as well with total lightning activity (r = {\textless}0.8) as updraft volume. Through expanded study designed to explore further regime variability (or lack thereof) of updraft volume-lightning flash rate relationships, better or refined parameterizations for the numerical forecasting of lightning and/or detection and prediction of storm intensity could be realized.},

	abstract = {Cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning data, wind field data derived from dual-Doppler radars, and radar reflectivity data are combined to investigate the relationships between CG lightning and the parameters associated with vertical airflow. A new method for the identification of thunderstorm cells based on the aggregation of flashes is developed. It is found that approximately 79.1\% of CG flashes are located in the region featuring weak vertical velocity at the 0°C level, ranging from −5 to 5ms−1, with the majority in the weak updraft region, especially for negative CG lightning and the CG lightning in the initial stage of thunderstorms. The CG lightning rate is correlated with the volume of updraft for vertical velocities within certain limits. The sum of absolute precipitation ice mass flux in the region from 7 to 11km is more significantly correlated with the CG flash rate, with correlation coefficients of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.74 for the initial, mature, and dissipating stages of thunderstorms, respectively. On average, the updraft in the thunderstorm at the stage when the last CG flash occurs accounts for a much smaller ratio to the whole volume of the thunderstorm than that corresponding to the first CG flash. The maximum updraft and maximum height of the 10 and 20ms−1 updraft speeds are close for the first and last CG flashes, indicating the dependence of the lightning on strength of updraft. It is deduced that layered large-range charges may be more conducive to the generation of CG flashes than charge pockets in the thunderstorm.},

It is based on matching the probabilities of the two variables. The observed reflectivity is often very different from the true reflectivity near the surface due to the averaging of the real reflectivity field aloft by the beam, path attenuation, and variations in the drop-size distribution (DSD) between the pulse volume and the surface. The probability-matching method (PMM) inherently accounts for all of these differences on average. The formulation of the {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions is constrained such that 1) the radar-retrieved probability density function (PDF) of {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} is identical to the gauge-measured PDF, and 2) the traction of the time that it is raining is identical for both the radar and for simultaneous, collocated gauge measurements. This ensures that the rain measured by the radar is equal to that observed at the gauges. The resultant {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions are not constrained to be power laws.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The method was applied to data obtained by a 1.65° beamwidth C-band radar and 22 gauges located near Darwin, Australia. The data were stratified by range and also by rainfall type. The resultant {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions manifest the nature of the PDF of {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} and the manner in which the beam effects the PDF of {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} through beam averaging and the average effects of C-band attenuation. In this regard, the {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} − {\textless}em{\textgreater}R{\textless}/em{\textgreater} functions reflect the nature of the precipitation. This provides the hope for greatly improved rainfall measurements, especially for climatic purposes and for sufficiently large space-time domains. In those climates where the storms closely resemble one another, the relations may be used for individual storms over their lifetime or for a few storms at any one moment. The time-space domain in this study was sufficient for the instability driven convective storm in Darwin but too small for the synoptic-scale systems.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The functions show a particularly strong range dependence for rain types characterized by large reflectivity gradients; that is, those in which the beam-average {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z$_{\textrm{e}}${\textless}/em{\textgreater} differs most from the actual reflectivity {\textless}em{\textgreater}Z{\textless}/em{\textgreater}. Because of the dominance of the beam effects relative to those due to variations in DSD, the use of radar polarimetry will improve the accuracy of rainfall retrievals, {\textless}em{\textgreater}based on specification of the DSD alone{\textless}/em{\textgreater}, only with narrow beams or at short ranges and for small-scale, short-term purposes when the probability based relations may not be representative.

In sharp contrast, the tropical oceanic profile has a maximum reflectivity at the lowest level and a very rapid decrease in reflectivity with height beginning just above the freezing level. The tropical oceanic profile in the Darwin area is almost the same shape as that for two other tropical oceanic regimes, leading to the conclusion that it is characteristic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}The absolute values of reflectivity in the 0° to −20°C range are compared with values in the literature thought to represent a threshold for rapid storm electrification leading to lightning, about 40 dBZ at −10°C. Most oceanic cells have reflectivities below the threshold; most midlatitude continental cells exceed the threshold, and the tropical continental cells are about equally divided above and below the threshold. The large negative vertical gradient of reflectivity in this temperature range for oceanic storms is hypothesized to be a direct result of the characteristically weaker vertical velocities observed in MCSs over tropical oceans. It is proposed, as a necessary condition for rapid electrification, that a convective cell must have its updraft speed exceed some threshold value. Based upon field program data, a tentative estimate for the magnitude of this threshold is 6–7 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ for mean speed and 10–12 m s$^{\textrm{−1}}$ for peak speed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

For GOES-16, an SNR analysis has been performed to accomplish this goal using ABI Mode-3 MESO visible near-infrared (VNIR) channel L1b radiance product images taken every 30 s between 17:00 UTC and 17:15 UTC on May 23, 2017. Scene pixel data used in the analysis are first screened to ensure they meet the low-light criteria and to minimize scene temporal variability associated with meteorological evolution and geolocation uncertainty in highly inhomogeneous scenes. After such screening, image-to-image radiance time difference statistics are compiled and analyzed to estimate instrument SNR. Based on GOES-R ABI vendor prelaunch testing, minimum and mean expected ABI Ch 2 postlaunch SNR performance at 5\% albedo was estimated to be 44.2 and 64.5, respectively. Meanwhile, the SNR computed in this analysis is found to be about 57 ± 8. Thus, low-light SNR for ABI Ch 2 is shown to meet minimum user expectations. The analysis for the other five GOES-16 ABI VNIR channels is also shown to contrast the SNR for these channels.},

The software has been designed to be used flexibly with any two- or three-dimensional time-varying input. The application of high-level data formats, such as {\textless}code{\textgreater}Iris{\textless}/code{\textgreater} cubes or {\textless}code{\textgreater}xarray{\textless}/code{\textgreater} arrays, for input and output allows for convenient use of metadata in the tracking analysis and visualisation. Comprehensive analysis routines are provided to derive properties like cloud lifetimes or statistics of cloud properties along with tools to visualise the results in a convenient way. The application of tobac is presented in two examples. We first track and analyse scattered deep convective cells based on maximum vertical velocity and the three-dimensional condensate mixing ratio field in cloud-resolving model simulations. We also investigate the performance of the tracking algorithm for different choices of time resolution of the model output. In the second application, we show how the framework can be used to effectively combine information from two different types of datasets by simultaneously tracking convective clouds in model simulations and in geostationary satellite images based on outgoing longwave radiation. The tobac framework provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of the characteristics of individual clouds in a range of important analyses like model intercomparison studies or model assessment based on observational data.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Statistical analyses show that previously published conclusions that increasing CN concentrations cause a decrease in minimum cloud-top temperature (CTT) at the SGP site through the aerosol convective invigoration effect are unfounded. The CN–CTT relationship is statistically insignificant, while correlations between convective available potential energy (CAPE), level of neutral buoyancy (LNB), and CN concentration account for most of the change in the CN–CTT positive correlation. Removal of clouds with minimum CTTs {\textgreater} −36°C from the analysis eliminates the CN–CTT correlation. Composited dirty conditions at the SGP have {\textasciitilde}1°C-warmer low levels and {\textasciitilde}1°C-cooler upper levels than clean conditions. This correlation between aerosol concentrations and thermodynamic profiles may be caused by an increase in regional rainfall preceding deep convective conditions as CN concentration decreases. Increased rainfall can be expected to increase wet deposition of aerosols, cool low-level temperatures, and warm upper-level temperatures. The masking of a potential aerosol effect by such small thermodynamic changes implies that the strategy of analyzing subsets of aerosol data by binned meteorological factor values is not a valid method for discerning an aerosol effect in some situations. These findings highlight the need for more careful, detailed, and strategic observations to confidently isolate and quantify an aerosol deep convective invigoration effect.},

By analyzing radiative–convective equilibrium simulations, we show that this behavior is rooted in basic energetic and thermodynamic properties of the atmosphere: As the climate warms, the clouds rise and remain at nearly the same temperature, but find themselves in a more stable atmosphere; this enhanced stability reduces the convective outflow in the upper troposphere and decreases the anvil cloud fraction. By warming the troposphere and increasing the upper-tropospheric stability, the clustering of deep convection also reduces the convective outflow and the anvil cloud fraction. When clouds are radiatively active, this robust coupling between temperature, high clouds, and circulation exerts a positive feedback on convective aggregation and favors the maintenance of strongly aggregated atmospheric states at high temperatures. This stability iris mechanism likely contributes to the narrowing of rainy areas as the climate warms. Whether or not it influences climate sensitivity requires further investigation.},

	abstract = {The surface temperature of Earth is being increased by human activities, principally by the release of greenhouse gases (1). Future warming will depend upon the rate at which greenhouse gases are released and the sensitivity of Earth’s surface temperature to those increased greenhouse gases. An often used metric of the sensitivity of Earth’s climate is the equilibrium climate sensitivity, the amount of global average surface warming that is the steady, long-term response to a doubling of carbon dioxide. The equilibrium climate sensitivity remains uncertain by about a factor of two, despite decades of study using evidence from basic theory, instrumental observations, paleoclimatic data, and global climate models (2). Global climate models indicate that a large contributor to uncertainty in climate sensitivity is the strength of cloud feedbacks. Cloud feedback is a response of cloud structure or amount to warming, which then alters the energy balance of Earth, which causes an additional change of surface temperature. An advance was made in the most recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which concluded that cloud feedback is likely positive, meaning that the response of clouds to climate change acts to increase the magnitude of the surface temperature change (3). This consensus is based in part on the development of basic physical understanding of why high clouds get higher (4) and low clouds decrease their area coverage in a warmed climate (5, 6). In PNAS, Bony et al. (7) propose a basic thermodynamic mechanism that may cause the temperature profile to become more stable in the upper troposphere when the Earth warms. They expect this stabilization to cause anvil cloud area to decrease in a warmed climate, although they conclude that the effect of this anvil area reduction on cloud feedback is uncertain.

We review the main mechanisms for cloud feedbacks, and discuss their representation in climate models and the sources of intermodel spread. Global-mean cloud feedback in GCMs results from three main effects: (1) rising free-tropospheric clouds (a positive longwave effect); (2) decreasing tropical low cloud amount (a positive shortwave [SW] effect); (3) increasing high-latitude low cloud optical depth (a negative SW effect). These cloud responses simulated by GCMs are qualitatively supported by theory, high-resolution modeling, and observations. Rising high clouds are consistent with the fixed anvil temperature (FAT) hypothesis, whereby enhanced upper-tropospheric radiative cooling causes anvil cloud tops to remain at a nearly fixed temperature as the atmosphere warms. Tropical low cloud amount decreases are driven by a delicate balance between the effects of vertical turbulent fluxes, radiative cooling, large-scale subsidence, and lower-tropospheric stability on the boundary-layer moisture budget. High-latitude low cloud optical depth increases are dominated by phase changes in mixed-phase clouds. The causes of intermodel spread in cloud feedback are discussed, focusing particularly on the role of unresolved parameterized processes such as cloud microphysics, turbulence, and convection.

	abstract = {The net radiative effects of tropical clouds are determined by the evolution of thick, freshly detrained anvil clouds into thin anvil clouds. Thick anvil clouds reduce Earth's energy balance and cool the climate, while thin anvil clouds warm the climate. To determine role of these clouds in climate change we need to understand how interactions of their microphysical and macrophysical properties control their radiative properties. We explore anvil cloud evolution using a cloud-resolving model in three-simulation setups of increasing complexity to disentangle the impacts of the various components of diabatic heating and their interaction with cloud-scale motions. The first phase of evolution and rapid cloud spreading is dominated by latent heating within convective updrafts. After the convective detrainment stops, most of the spreading and thinning of the anvil cloud is driven by cloud radiative processes and latent heating. The combination of radiative cooling at cloud top, latent cooling due to sublimation at cloud base, latent heating due to deposition and radiative heating in between leads to a sandwich-like, cooling-heating-cooling structure. The heating sandwich promotes the development of two within-anvil convective layers and a double cell circulation, dominated by strong outflow at 12-km altitude with inflow above and below. Our study reveals how small-scale processes including convective, microphysical processes, latent and radiative heating interact within the anvil cloud system. The absence or a different representation of only one component results in a significantly different cloud evolution with large impacts on cloud radiative effects.},

Using data from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) imaging radiometer aboard a geostationary Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite, dynamical and microphysical properties of developing storms were monitored and combined. Several satellite-based storm properties, for example, cloud-top temperature, cloud-top cooling rate, and cloud particle effective radius, were investigated following the storm tracks. A framework for quantification of uncertainties of along-track properties resulting from tracking errors was also introduced. The majority of studied storms show a distinct maximum in cloud-top cooling rate; the corresponding time was used for track synchronization. The cloud growth phase was divided into an initial updraft intensification period before the maximum cooling and a continued growth period afterward. The initial updraft intensification period is variable and strongly depends on the convection initiation mechanism and detection conditions. The continued growth period is more confined, lasting between 30 and 45 min. The change in anvil size and the resulting average anvil edge velocity were determined from infrared satellite images. As a consequence of mass transport, the anvil edge velocity shows its highest correlation with the cloud-top vertical velocity approximately 20–30 min after the maximum in the cloud-top cooling rate. Larger effective radii of ice crystals were observed for vertically slower-growing clouds. The largest anticorrelation between cloud-top vertical velocity and effective radius was found at a time lag of 20 min after the maximum in cloud-top cooling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

Dynamical growth properties as well as cloud-top glaciation and microphysical characteristics are derived from the SEVIRI imaging radiometer aboard the geostationary Meteosat satellites. In addition, onset and intensity of surface precipitation are related to growth and glaciation processes using observations from the radar network of the German Weather Service. The majority of analyzed cases shows a distinct maximum in cloud-top cooling rate, which is used here for temporal synchronization. Cloud growth spans a period of approximately half an hour. Glaciation rate indicators suggest that freezing 15 min prior to the maximum cooling plays an important role in invigorating convective updrafts through the release of latent heat. Smaller ice particles are found for larger cloud-top cooling, which provides observational evidence that ice particles form later and have less time to grow in stronger convective updrafts. Furthermore, maximum cloud-top height, anvil expansion rate, maximum precipitation intensity, and core size are found to be positively correlated. With respect to the onset of precipitation, this analysis shows a high probability that significant precipitation already occurs 30 min prior to maximum cloud-top cooling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Deep convective systems (DCSs) consist of intense convective cores (CC), large stratiform rain (SR) regions, and extensive nonprecipitating anvil clouds (AC). This study focuses on the evolution of these three components and the factors that affect system lifetime and AC production. An automated satellite tracking method is used in conjunction with a recently developed multisensor hybrid classification to analyze the evolution of DCS structure in a Lagrangian framework over the central United States. Composite analysis from 4221 tracked DCSs during two warm seasons (May–August, 2010–2011) shows that maximum system size correlates with lifetime, and longer-lived DCSs have more extensive SR and AC. For short to medium systems (lifetimes {\textless}6 h), the lifetime is mainly attributed to the intensity of the initial convection. Systems that last longer than 6 h are associated with up to 50\% higher midtropospheric relative humidity and up to 40\% stronger middle to upper tropospheric wind shear. Such environments allow continuous growth of detrained hydrometeors by deposition, supporting further development of the SR and AC region, as indicated by the increased staggered timing between stratiform clouds and peak convective intensity, thus prolonging the system lifetime beyond 6 h. Regression analysis shows that the areal coverage of thick AC is strongly correlated with the size of CC, updraft strength, and SR area. Ambient upper tropospheric wind speed and wind shear also play an important role for convective AC production, where for systems with large AC (radius {\textgreater}120 km) they are 24\% and 20\% higher, respectively, than those with small AC (radius = 20 km).},

	abstract = {This study develops an understanding on how retrieved cloud parameter fields from the Optimal Cloud Analysis (OCA) algorithm, operating on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) data, behave at 5-min time resolutions for growing cumulus clouds. Fields retrieved by the OCA algorithm include cloud optical thickness (τ), cloud-top particle effective radius (re), cloud-top pressure (pc), and cloud-top phase. OCA is based on a one-dimensional optimal estimation methodology, and a measure of radiance fit, the cost function (Jm), is a quantity developed as part of the retrieval process and is shown to be useful in delineating mixed phase clouds; it too is evaluated (at 5-min intervals) for the information it provides. Data for 94 growing cumulus cloud events are processed. An “event” is defined as a cumulus cloud that is monitored at 5-min intervals with OCA, as it grows from the “fair weather” or “towering cumulus” stage to near the cumulonimbus stage when precipitation begins. The hypothesis is that OCA products are of high-enough quality to provide unique information about microphysical processes occurring at and near cloud top. The goal through analysis of the 94 events is to identify consistent, repeating patterns in OCA fields during cloud growth that can be in turn used to infer physical processes. Data from the Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study (June and July 2007) and in four regions of Europe on 25 May 2009 are used. The validity of the OCA data is presented with a comparison to CloudSat Precipitation Radar and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer retrieved cloud properties, showing good statistical agreements. Subsequently, results from the analysis of OCA fields for all events show that as cumuli deepen, re values tend to increase, and then decrease in size as cloud tops glaciate and particle settling begins. The τ magnitudes generally increase as clouds deepen, while pc values and cloud-top temperatures fall as expected. The Jm values exhibit the pattern of spiking in magnitude (over a 5–10-min period), which indicates the increase “misfit” within OCA during the mixed phase, at about the time τ values increase substantially as clouds deepen.},

Long-lived and intense MCSs account for over 50\% of warm season precipitation in the Great Plains and over 40\% of cold season precipitation in the southeast. The Great Plains has the strongest MCS seasonal cycle peaking in May–June, whereas in the U.S. southeast MCSs occur year-round. Distinctly different large-scale environments across the seasons have significant impacts on the structure of MCSs. Spring and fall MCSs commonly initiate under strong baroclinic forcing and favorable thermodynamic environments. MCS genesis frequently occurs in the Great Plains near sunset, although convection is not always surface based. Spring MCSs feature both large and deep convection, with a large stratiform rain area and high volume of rainfall. In contrast, summer MCSs often initiate under weak baroclinic forcing, featuring a high pressure ridge with weak low-level convergence acting on the warm, humid air associated with the low-level jet. MCS genesis concentrates east of the Rocky Mountain Front Range and near the southeast coast in the afternoon. The strongest MCS diurnal cycle amplitude extends from the foothills of the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains. Summer MCSs have the largest and deepest convective features, the smallest stratiform rain area, and the lowest rainfall volume. Last, winter MCSs are characterized by the strongest baroclinic forcing and the largest MCS precipitation features over the southeast. Implications of the findings for climate modeling are discussed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Increasing global precipitation has been associated with a warming climate resulting from a strengthening of the hydrological cycle1. This increase, however, is not spatially uniform. Observations and models have found that changes in rainfall show patterns characterized as ‘wet-gets-wetter’1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and ‘warmer-gets-wetter’5,8,9. These changes in precipitation are largely located in the tropics and hence are probably associated with convection. However, the underlying physical processes for the observed changes are not entirely clear. Here we show from observations that most of the regional increase in tropical precipitation is associated with changes in the frequency of organized deep convection. By assessing the contributions of various convective regimes to precipitation, we find that the spatial patterns of change in the frequency of organized deep convection are strongly correlated with observed change in rainfall, both positive and negative (correlation of 0.69), and can explain most of the patterns of increase in rainfall. In contrast, changes in less organized forms of deep convection or changes in precipitation within organized deep convection contribute less to changes in precipitation. Our results identify organized deep convection as the link between changes in rainfall and in the dynamics of the tropical atmosphere, thus providing a framework for obtaining a better understanding of changes in rainfall. Given the lack of a distinction between the different degrees of organization of convection in climate models10, our results highlight an area of priority for future climate model development in order to achieve accurate rainfall projections in a warming climate.},

The Global Precipitation Measurement core satellite, which features a space-borne Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar providing near-global coverage (65°S to 65°N), has made it possible to establish the occurrence of convective storms at high latitudes. Analysis of the three-dimensional radar echoes seen by Global Precipitation Measurement over a 5-year period (2014–2018) shows that extremely intense deep convective storms do occur often during the warm season (April–September) in the high-latitude continents where the increase of surface temperature has been greatest.

	abstract = {Energetic constraints on precipitation are useful for understanding the response of the hydrological cycle to ongoing climate change, its response to possible geoengineering schemes, and the limits on precipitation in very warm climates of the past. Much recent progress has been made in quantifying the different forcings and feedbacks on precipitation and in understanding how the transient responses of precipitation and temperature might differ qualitatively. Here, we introduce the basic ideas and review recent progress. We also examine the extent to which energetic constraints on precipitation may be viewed as radiative constraints and the extent to which they are confirmed by available observations. Challenges remain, including the need to better demonstrate the link between energetics and precipitation in observations and to better understand energetic constraints on precipitation at sub-global length scales.},

	abstract = {From a societal, weather, and climate perspective, precipitation intensity, duration, frequency, and phase are as much of concern as total amounts, as these factors determine the disposition of precipitation once it hits the ground and how much runs off. At the extremes of precipitation incidence are the events that give rise to floods and droughts, whose changes in occurrence and severity have an enormous impact on the environment and society. Hence, advancing understanding and the ability to model and predict the character of precipitation is vital but requires new approaches to examining data and models. Various mechanisms, storms and so forth, exist to bring about precipitation. Because the rate of precipitation, conditional on when it falls, greatly exceeds the rate of replenishment of moisture by surface evaporation, most precipitation comes from moisture already in the atmosphere at the time the storm begins, and transport of moisture by the storm-scale circulation into the storm is vital. Hence, the intensity of precipitation depends on available moisture, especially for heavy events. As climate warms, the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is governed by the Clausius–Clapeyron equation, is expected to rise much faster than the total precipitation amount, which is governed by the surface heat budget through evaporation. This implies that the main changes to be experienced are in the character of precipitation: increases in intensity must be offset by decreases in duration or frequency of events. The timing, duration, and intensity of precipitation can be systematically explored via the diurnal cycle, whose correct simulation in models remains an unsolved challenge of vital importance in global climate change. Typical problems include the premature initiation of convection, and precipitation events that are too light and too frequent. These challenges in observations, modeling, and understanding precipitation changes are being taken up in the NCAR “Water Cycle Across Scales” initiative, which will exploit the diurnal cycle as a test bed for a hierarchy of models to promote improvements in models.},

These observations reveal a distinct link between rainfall extremes and temperature, with heavy rain events increasing during warm periods and decreasing during cold periods. Furthermore, the observed amplification of rainfall extremes is found to be larger than that predicted by models, implying that projections of future changes in rainfall extremes in response to anthropogenic global warming may be underestimated.},

	abstract = {The response of the hydrological cycle to climate forcings can be understood within the atmospheric energy budget framework. In this study precipitation and energy budget responses to five forcing agents are analyzed using 10 climate models from the Precipitation Driver Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP). Precipitation changes are split into a forcing-dependent fast response and a temperature-driven hydrological sensitivity. Globally, when normalized by top-of-atmosphere (TOA) forcing, fast precipitation changes are most sensitive to strongly absorbing drivers (CO2, black carbon). However, over land fast precipitation changes are most sensitive to weakly absorbing drivers (sulfate, solar) and are linked to rapid circulation changes. Despite this, land-mean fast responses to CO2 and black carbon exhibit more intermodel spread. Globally, the hydrological sensitivity is consistent across forcings, mainly associated with increased longwave cooling, which is highly correlated with intermodel spread. The land-mean hydrological sensitivity is weaker, consistent with limited moisture availability. The PDRMIP results are used to construct a simple model for land-mean and sea-mean precipitation change based on sea surface temperature change and TOA forcing. The model matches well with CMIP5 ensemble mean historical and future projections, and is used to understand the contributions of different drivers. During the twentieth century, temperature-driven intensification of land-mean precipitation has been masked by fast precipitation responses to anthropogenic sulfate and volcanic forcing, consistent with the small observed trend. However, as projected sulfate forcing decreases, and warming continues, land-mean precipitation is expected to increase more rapidly, and may become clearly observable by the mid-twenty-first century.},

A surprising finding is that a robust decrease in extratropical sensible heat transport is found only in the equilibrium climate response, as estimated in slab ocean responses to the doubling of CO2, and not in transient climate change scenarios. All of these robust responses are consequences of the increase in lower-tropospheric water vapor.},

Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) have regions of both convective and stratiform precipitation, and they develop mesoscale circulations as they mature. The upward motion takes the form of a deep-layer ascent drawn into the MCS in response to the latent heating and cooling in the convective region. The ascending layer overturns as it rises but overall retains a coherent layer structure. A middle level layer of inflow enters the stratiform region of the MCS from a direction determined by the large-scale flow and descends in response to diabatic cooling at middle-to-low levels. A middle level mesoscale convective vortex (MCV) develops in the stratiform region, prolongs the MCS, and may contribute to tropical cyclone development. The propagation of an MCS may have a discrete component but may further be influenced by waves and disturbances generated both in response to the MCS and external to the MCS. Waves of a larger scale may affect the propagation velocity by phase locking with the MCS in a cooperative mode. The horizontal scale of an MCS may be limited either by a balance between the formation rate of convective precipitation and dissipation of stratiform precipitation or by the Rossby radius of the MCV. The vertical redistribution of momentum by an MCS depends on the size of the stratiform region, while the net vertical profile of heating of the large-scale environment depends on the amount of stratiform rain. Regional variability of the stratiform rain from MCSs affects the large-scale circulation's response to MCS heating.},

While the large-scale flow establishes environmental conditions favorable for severe weather, processes on the mesoscale initiate such storms, affect their evolution, and influence their environment. A rich variety of mesocale processes are involved in severe weather, ranging from environmental preconditioning to storm initiation to feedback of convection on the environment. In the space available, it is not possible to treat all of these processes in detail. Rather, we will introduce several general classifications of mesoscale processes relating to severe weather and give illustrative examples. Although processes on the mesoscale are often intimately linked with those on smaller and larger scales, we will exclude from discussion those that obviously lie outside the mesoscale domain (e.g., baroclinic waves on the synoptic scale or charge separation in clouds on the microscale).},

	abstract = {Conventional surface data and quantitative estimations of precipitation are used to document the occurrence and spatial distribution of severe weather phenomena associated with deep moist convection over southeastern South America. Data used in this paper are 24-hour rainfall, maximum hourly gusts and present weather reports from the surface station network for Argentina to the north of 40°S and cover the period 2000–2005. Hourly rainfall estimated with the CMORPH technique (CPC MORPHing technique, R. J. Joyce et al., 2004) is included in the analysis in order to increase the density of the precipitation database from January 2003 to December 2005. Extreme events are detected by means of a 95th-percentile analysis of the 24-hour rainfall and wind; values greater than 30mm and 25ms−1 respectively are considered extreme in the study area. These results are related to the presence of deep convection by considering the 235K and 218K cloud shield evolution in Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-12 Infrared (GOES-IR) imagery evaluated by the Forecasting and Tracking of Cloud Cluster (FORTRACC) technique. Rainfall above 30mmday−1 and present convection-related weather events tend to occur in the northeast of the country. Finally, an analysis is made of the relationship between severe phenomena and the location and lifecycle of Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) defined by the 218K or 235K levels. According to the reports, favorable locations for severe weather concentrate to the northeast of the cloud shield anvil centroid although most of the cases are found in the northwest. This feature can be seen in systems with anvil areas larger than 250,000km2 in association to the predominant mid-level wind shear direction from the northwest over the area. Moreover, systems with centers located north of 30°S present a more circular shape while those to the south are more elongated with a NW–SE main axis clearly related to the presence and interaction with frontal zones over the area. Most of the events occur previous to the moment when the systems reach their maximum extension, between 2 and 10h after the initiation of the system depending on the size of the MCSs.},

This article will give a comprehensive overview and review of the present state of knowledge on hail hazard and hail frequency over recent decades up to centuries across Europe and is intended as a reference for future studies.

Break period convection consists primarily of deep continental convection, whereas oceanic-based convection dominates during monsoonal periods, associated with the monsoon trough over Darwin. Order-of-magnitude enhancements in lightning flash rates for the “break period” regime are associated with 10–20-dB enhancements in radar reflectivity in the mixed-phase region of the convection compared with the monsoonal regime. The latter differences are attributed to the effect of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and its nonlinear influence on the growth and accumulation of ice particles aloft, which are believed to promote charge separation by differential particle motions. CAPE, in turn, is largely determined by the boundary-layer wet-bulb temperature. Modest differences (1°–3°C) in wet-bulb potential temperature between land and sea may account for the order-of-magnitude contrast in recently observed land–ocean lightning activity.},

Validation is conducted along the well-known skill measures probability of detection (POD) and false alarm ratio (FAR) on the basis of Meteosat/SEVIRI pixels as well as on the basis of thunderstorm objects. The values obtained demonstrate specific limitations of Cb-TRAM, as well as limitations of satellite methods in general which are based on thermal emission and solar reflectivity information from thunderstorm cloud tops. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Although the climatic conditions and the occurrence of thunderstorms are quite different for Europe and South Africa, quality score values are similar. Our conclusion is that Cb-TRAM provides robust results of well-defined quality for very different climatic regimes. The POD for a thunderstorm with intense lightning is about 80\% during the day. The FAR for a Cb-TRAM detection which is not even close to intense lightning is about 50\%. If only proximity to any lightning activity is required, FAR is much lower at about 15\%. Pixel-based analysis shows that detected thunderstorm object size is not indiscriminately large, but well within physical limitations of the satellite method. Night-time POD and FAR are somewhat worse as the detection scheme does not use the high-resolution visible information during night-time hours. Nowcasting scores show useful values up to approximately 30 min in advance.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {This study presents a novel approach for the early detection of developing thunderstorms. To date, methods for the detection of developing thunderstorms have usually relied on accurate Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) for the estimation of the cooling rates of convective clouds, which correspond to the updraft strengths of the cloud objects. In this study, we present a method for the estimation of the updraft strength that does not rely on AMVs. The updraft strength is derived directly from the satellite observations in the SEVIRI water vapor channels. For this purpose, the absolute value of the vector product of spatio-temporal gradients of the SEVIRI water vapor channels is calculated for each satellite pixel, referred to as Normalized Updraft Strength (NUS). The main idea of the concept is that vertical updraft leads to NUS values significantly above zero, whereas horizontal cloud movement leads to NUS values close to zero. Thus, NUS is a measure of the strength of the vertical updraft and can be applied to distinguish between advection and convection. The performance of the method has been investigated for two summer periods in 2016 and 2017 by validation with lightning data. Values of the Critical Success Index (CSI) of about 66\% for 2016 and 60\% for 2017 demonstrate the good performance of the method. The Probability of Detection (POD) values for the base case are 81.8\% for 2016 and 89.2\% for 2017, respectively. The corresponding False Alarm Ratio (FAR) values are 22.6\% (2016) and 36.4\% (2017), respectively. In summary, the method has the potential to reduce forecast lead time significantly and can be quite useful in regions without a well-maintained radar network.},

	abstract = {SummaryCb-TRAM is a new fully automated tracking and nowcasting algorithm. Intense convective cells are detected, tracked and discriminated with respect to onset, rapid development, and mature phase. The detection is based on Meteosat-8 SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infra-Red Imager) data from the broad band high resolution visible, infra-red 6.2 µm (water vapour), and the infra-red 10.8 µm channels. In addition, tropopause temperature data from ECMWF operational model analyses is utilised as an adaptive detection criterion. The tracking is based on geographical overlap between current detections and first guess patterns of cells predicted from preceeding time steps. The first guess patterns as well as short range forecast extrapolations are obtained with the aid of a new image matching algorithm providing complete fields of approximate differential cloud motion. Based on these motion vector fields interpolation and extrapolation of satellite data are obtained which allow to generate synthetic intermediate data fields between two known fields as well as nowcasts of motion and development of detected areas. Examples of the application of Cb-TRAM and a comparison to precipitation radar and lightning data as independent data sources demonstrate the capabilities of the new technique.},

	abstract = {Observations from a geostationary satellite are used to study the life cycle of mesoscale convective systems (MCS), their associated anvil clouds, and their effects on the radiation balance over the warm pool of the tropical western Pacific Ocean. In their developing stages, MCS primarily consist of clouds that are optically thick and have a negative net cloud radiative effect (CRE). As MCS age, ice crystals in the anvil become larger, the cloud top lowers somewhat, and cloud radiative effects decrease in magnitude. Shading from anvils causes cool anomalies in the underlying sea surface temperature (SST) of up to −0.6°C. MCS often occur in clusters that are embedded within large westward-propagating disturbances, and therefore shading from anvils can cool SSTs over regions spanning hundreds of kilometers. Triggering of convection is more likely to follow a warm SST anomaly than a cold SST anomaly on a time scale of several days. This information is used to evaluate hypotheses for why, over the warm pool, the average shortwave and longwave CRE are individually large but nearly cancel. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cancellation in CRE is caused by feedbacks among cloud albedo, large-scale circulation, and SST.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Quantitative precipitation nowcasting (QPN) has become an essential technique in various application contexts, such as early warning or urban sewage control. A common heuristic prediction approach is to track the motion of precipitation features from a sequence of weather radar images and then to displace the precipitation field to the imminent future (minutes to hours) based on that motion, assuming that the intensity of the features remains constant (“Lagrangian persistence”). In that context, “optical flow” has become one of the most popular tracking techniques. Yet the present landscape of computational QPN models still struggles with producing open software implementations. Focusing on this gap, we have developed and extensively benchmarked a stack of models based on different optical flow algorithms for the tracking step and a set of parsimonious extrapolation procedures based on image warping and advection. We demonstrate that these models provide skillful predictions comparable with or even superior to state-of-the-art operational software. Our software library (“rainymotion”) for precipitation nowcasting is written in the Python programming language and openly available at GitHub ({\textless}span class="uri"{\textgreater}https://github.com/hydrogo/rainymotion{\textless}/span{\textgreater}, {\textless}span class="cit" id="xref\_altparen.1"{\textgreater}{\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx3"{\textgreater}Ayzel et al.{\textless}/a{\textgreater}, {\textless}a href="\#bib1.bibx3"{\textgreater}2019{\textless}/a{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}). That way, the library may serve as a tool for providing fast, free, and transparent solutions that could serve as a benchmark for further model development and hypothesis testing – a benchmark that is far more advanced than the conventional benchmark of Eulerian persistence commonly used in QPN verification experiments.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {A new advection-based nowcasting scheme for precipitation has been developed for the Gandolf system. The method employed removes the need to split the radar analysis into contiguous rain areas (CRA's) and uses a smoothness constraint. Thus, it is similar to the Variational Echo Tracking approach. Optical flow ideas are used to diagnose the advection velocity of blocks within rain analyses, which involve the direct solution of the Lagrangian persistence equation. In block-based approaches, the radar analyses are partitioned a-priori and a CRA may be split over a number of blocks. This scheme is compared with the old Gandolf advection scheme, which is based on CRA's, and the new scheme performs better-both in cases associated with severe flooding and over a continuous verification period of 3 months. The benefit is conjectured to be due mainly to the difficulty in unambiguously identifying CRA's, which is particularly troublesome on small domains, such as the UK. Thus, it is concluded that block-based methods are likely to be superior to object-based methods in the majority of cases.},

	abstract = {Hong Kong Observatory has been operating an in-house developed rainfall nowcasting system called “Short-range Warning of Intense Rainstorms in Localized Systems (SWIRLS)” to support rainstorm warning and rainfall nowcasting services. A crucial step in rainfall nowcasting is the tracking of radar echoes to generate motion fields for extrapolation of rainfall areas in the following few hours. SWIRLS adopted a correlation-based method in its first operational version in 1999, which was subsequently replaced by optical flow algorithm in 2010 and further enhanced in 2013. The latest optical flow algorithm employs a transformation function to enhance a selected range of reflectivity for feature tracking. It also adopts variational optical flow computation that takes advantage of the Horn–Schunck approach and the Lucas–Kanade method. This paper details the three radar echo tracking algorithms, examines their performances in several significant rainstorm cases and summaries verification results of multi-year performances. The limitations of the current approach are discussed. Developments underway along with future research areas are also presented.},

	abstract = {The atmospheric state evolution is an inherently highly complex three-dimensional problem that numerical weather prediction (NWP) models attempt to solve. Although NWP models are being successfully employed for medium- and long-range forecast, their short-duration forecast (or nowcast) capabilities are still limited because of model initialization challenges. On the lower end of the complexity scale, nowcasting by extrapolation of two-dimensional weather radar images has long been the most effective tool for nowcasting precipitation. Attempts are being made to take advantage of both approaches by blending extrapolation and numerical model forecasts. In this work a different approach is presented, relying on the additional Doppler radar wind information and a simplified modeling of basic physical processes. Instead of mixing the outputs of different forecasts as in blended approaches, the idea behind this study is to combine extrapolation and precipitation modeling in a new technique with a higher level of complexity with respect to conventional nowcasting methods, although still much simpler than NWP models. As a preliminary step, the Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS) is used to provide an initial analysis exploiting all the available dual-polarization and Doppler radar observations. The rainwater and wind fields are then advected using an optical flow technique that is subject to simplified physical interactions. As a result precipitation and wind nowcasting are obtained and are successively validated up to a 1-h lead time, showing potential improvement upon standard extrapolation.},
